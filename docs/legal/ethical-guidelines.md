# Ethical Guidelines for S.A.M. and Phronesis Use

Responsible use principles and ethical constraints for institutional accountability analysis.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Institutional Accountability, Not Individual Blame

**Purpose**: S.A.M. analyzes systemic patterns, not individual culpability

**Focus on**:
- Structural factors enabling false premise propagation
- Institutional incentives and constraints
- Process failures and gaps

**Avoid**:
- Personal attacks on individual actors
- Assuming bad faith without evidence
- Ignoring institutional context

### 2. Power Dynamics Matter

**Apply adversarial skepticism to power, not vulnerability**

**Appropriate targets**:
- Government agencies
- Large institutions
- Professional authorities
- Powerful organizations

**Inappropriate targets**:
- Individuals subject to institutional power
- Vulnerable populations
- Marginalized communities

### 3. Transparency and Due Process

**Methodology must be transparent**:
- Document analytical process
- Disclose assumptions and limitations
- Provide complete citation chains
- Enable replication

**Provide opportunity for response**:
- Share findings with reviewed institutions when appropriate
- Allow response to criticism
- Consider alternative explanations
- Update analysis if new evidence emerges

### 4. Truth-Seeking Over Advocacy

**Commitment to accuracy**:
- Follow evidence wherever it leads
- Report null findings honestly
- Acknowledge limitations and uncertainties
- Resist pressure to reach predetermined conclusions

**Distinguish analysis from advocacy**:
- S.A.M. identifies patterns; policy recommendations are separate
- Present findings objectively
- Disclose potential conflicts of interest

## Vulnerable Populations

Special care required when analysis involves:

**Children**: Extra privacy protections; focus on institutional failures, not family behavior

**Medical Patients**: HIPAA compliance; focus on institutional practices, not patient behavior

**Criminal Defendants**: Presumption of innocence; analyze prosecution's case, not defendant's statements

**Marginalized Communities**: Avoid reinforcing stereotypes or biases

---

## Privacy and Confidentiality

**Redact unnecessary personal information**:
- Names of non-public figures
- Addresses and contact information
- Medical details
- Financial information
- Children's identities

**Balance transparency and privacy**:
- Sufficient detail for credibility
- Minimal necessary personal information
- Focus on patterns, not individuals

See [Redaction Guidelines](../case-studies/redaction-guidelines.md) for details.
