---

## Overview

S.A.M. analyses may be presented as expert testimony in legal proceedings. This document addresses standards for admissibility and professional conduct.

---

## Admissibility Standards

### Daubert Standard (US Federal Courts)

**Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**, 509 U.S. 579 (1993)

**Five Factors** (non-exhaustive):

1. **Testability**: Can the theory or technique be tested?
   - **S.A.M.**: Yes. Methodology is systematic and replicable.

2. **Peer Review and Publication**: Has it been published and subjected to peer review?
   - **S.A.M.**: Methodology paper published; validation studies planned.

3. **Error Rate**: Known or potential error rate?
   - **S.A.M.**: Validation framework includes error rate assessment.

4. **Standards**: Standards controlling operation of technique?
   - **S.A.M.**: Documented standards for each phase and contradiction type.

5. **General Acceptance**: Generally accepted in relevant scientific community?
   - **S.A.M.**: Emerging methodology; building acceptance through publications and validation.

**Judge as Gatekeeper**: Trial judge determines admissibility.

### Frye Standard (Some US States)

**Frye v. United States**, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923)

**General Acceptance Test**: Methodology must be generally accepted in relevant scientific community.

**S.A.M. Approach**:
- Grounded in established fields (social epistemology, institutional theory)
- Building community acceptance through publications
- Validation studies to demonstrate reliability

### Other Jurisdictions

**Canada**: *R. v. Mohan* test (relevance, necessity, reliability, absence of exclusionary rule).

**UK**: Expert evidence admissible if within expert's area of expertise and assists court.

**Australia**: Similar to UK; admissibility if expert qualified and evidence relevant.

Consult local rules for specific requirements.

## Daubert Hearing Preparation

### Expected Questions

**Testability**:
- Can S.A.M. be tested?
- How would you test it?
- Has it been tested?

**Peer Review**:
- Has methodology been published?
- Where published?
- Has it been peer reviewed?

## Common Objections and Responses

### "This is novel/untested methodology"

**Response**: Grounded in established fields (social epistemology, institutional theory, argumentation theory). Validation framework in place. Methodology transparent and replicable.

### "No general acceptance"

**Response**: Emerging methodology building acceptance. Based on established principles. Validation studies underway. General acceptance not required under Daubert (though helpful).

### "Error rates unknown"

**Response**: Validation framework includes error rate assessment. Preliminary inter-rater reliability studies show [results]. Ongoing validation. Acknowledge emerging status.

### "Expert is biased"

**Response**: Disclose compensation, relationships. Explain commitment to objectivity. Followed evidence wherever it led. Considered alternative explanations. Analysis replicable by independent experts.

### "Cherry-picked evidence"

**Response**: Analyzed complete document corpus. Audit trail shows all documents reviewed. Contradicting information discussed. Alternative explanations addressed.

---

## Ethics

### Model Rule 3.3 (Candor to Tribunal)

Cannot make false statement of fact or law. Must correct if discover previous statement false.

**For Experts**: Must correct testimony if discover error.

### Avoiding Advocacy

**Distinguish** opinion (expert's role) from advocacy (attorney's role).

**Present** findings objectively, let attorneys argue implications.

### Disclosing Limitations

**Ethical Obligation**: Disclose limitations and uncertainties.

**Credibility**: Honest disclosure enhances credibility.

---

## Compensation

### Reasonable Fees

**Hourly or Flat Fee**: Common structures.
