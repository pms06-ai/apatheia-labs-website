# Best Practices

Tips for effective S.A.M. analysis and common pitfalls to avoid.

---

## Document Management

### Before Import

**Organize systematically**:
- Chronological file naming: `001_date_doctype.pdf`
- Group by institution or category
- Include metadata files if available

**Ensure quality**:
- Good OCR quality (300+ DPI for scans)
- Complete document sets
- Note missing documents

**Prepare workspace**:
- Sufficient storage space
- Backup plan
- Secure device

### During Import

**Batch processing**:
- Import in logical groups
- Verify each batch before continuing
- Don't overload system

**Quality check**:
- Review OCR extraction
- Fix critical errors
- Note quality issues

## Analysis Strategy

### Start Simple

**Initial pass**:
- Quick analysis first
- Get familiar with case
- Identify key patterns

**Iterative deepening**:
- Add engines incrementally
- Focus analysis on key issues
- Full S.A.M. after initial understanding

### Focus on Key Claims

**Not all claims equal**:
- Prioritize claims supporting harmful outcomes
- Focus on false premises with high authority
- Track most significant contradictions

**Efficiency**:
- Don't get lost in minutiae
- Keep sight of big picture
- Document as you go

---

## Verification Practices

### Always Verify AI Findings

**Check every citation**:
- Read source in context
- Verify quote accuracy
- Assess reasonableness

**Consider alternatives**:
- Are there other explanations?
- What assumptions are made?
- What evidence contradicts?

**Manual override when needed**:
- You have final judgment
- Document disagreements with AI
- Provide rationale

### Cross-Check Critical Findings

**High-stakes findings** require:
- Independent verification
- Peer review if possible
- Multiple sources
- Conservative interpretation

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Confirmation Bias

**Problem**: Seeing what you expect to see.

**Mitigation**:
- Actively seek contradicting evidence
- Consider alternative explanations
- Have independent review
- Document reasoning process

### 2. Overreliance on AI

**Problem**: Accepting AI outputs uncritically.

**Mitigation**:
- Verify all findings
- Understand limitations
- Check for hallucinations
- Use AI to assist, not replace judgment

### 3. Incomplete Document Sets

**Problem**: Drawing conclusions from partial information.

**Mitigation**:
- Document gaps explicitly
- Qualify conclusions appropriately
- Seek missing documents
- Note how gaps affect findings

### 4. Scope Creep

**Problem**: Analysis becomes unfocused and endless.

**Mitigation**:
- Define scope at outset
- Stay focused on key questions
- Set time limits
- Prioritize ruthlessly

### 5. Attribution Errors

**Problem**: Misattributing claims or confusing sources.

**Mitigation**:
- Careful entity resolution
- Track pronouns and references
- Verify attribution before claiming
- Note ambiguities

## Quality Assurance

### Self-Review Checklist

Before finalizing:
- [ ] All citations verified
- [ ] Alternative explanations considered
- [ ] Limitations documented
- [ ] Findings independently checkable
- [ ] Reasoning transparent
- [ ] Conclusions proportionate to evidence

### Peer Review

**When possible**:
- Independent analyst review
- Domain expert consultation
- Methodology review
- Adversarial testing

---

## Reporting Best Practices

### Structure

**Clear organization**:
- Executive summary
- Methodology explanation
- Findings with evidence
- Limitations
- Conclusions

**Citation discipline**:
- Every claim cited
- Citations complete and accurate
- Original context preserved

### Clarity

**Accessible writing**:
- Define technical terms
- Explain methodology
- Use visualizations
- Provide examples

**Avoid jargon** when possible; explain when necessary.

### Transparency

**Full disclosure**:
- Methodology and process
- Assumptions and limitations
- Alternative explanations
- Uncertainties

---

## Ethical Considerations

### Privacy

**Redact appropriately**:
- See [Redaction Guidelines](../case-studies/redaction-guidelines.md)
- Err on side of privacy
- Focus on patterns, not individuals

### Fairness

**Due process**:
- Provide opportunity for response (when appropriate)
- Consider institutional constraints
- Distinguish good faith errors from misconduct
- Proportionate response

### Objectivity

**Follow evidence**:
- Report null findings honestly
- Don't overstate conclusions
- Acknowledge uncertainties
- Resist pressure for predetermined outcomes

---

## Time Management

### Estimate Realistically

**Small case** (20-50 docs): 1-2 weeks  
**Medium case** (50-200 docs): 2-4 weeks  
**Large case** (200-1000+ docs): 1-3 months

**Add time for**:
- Document gathering
- Quality issues
- Unexpected complexity
- Review and revision

### Prioritize

**Critical path**:
1. Document collection
2. Initial review and familiarization
3. Entity and timeline (foundation)
4. Key claim analysis
5. S.A.M. phases
6. Report generation

---

## Collaboration

### Working with Legal Team

**Communication**:
- Regular updates
- Shared understanding of goals
- Clarify legal standards
- Coordinate disclosure strategy

**Division of labor**:
- Analyst: Methodology, factual findings
- Attorney: Legal arguments, strategy

### Working with Domain Experts

**Consultation**:
- Medical experts for medical cases
- Social work experts for child protection
- Forensic experts for criminal cases

**Respect expertise**:
- Combine methodological rigor with domain knowledge
- Explain S.A.M. clearly
- Be open to feedback

---

## Continuous Improvement

### Learn from Each Case

**Document lessons**:
- What worked well?
- What was challenging?
- What would you do differently?
- What patterns emerged?

**Refine approach**:
- Adjust parameters based on experience
- Develop case-specific templates
- Build reference library

---

## Technical Tips

### Performance

**Large cases**:
- Process in batches
- Run overnight
- Use faster AI provider for initial pass
- Export subsets for targeted analysis

### Backup

**Regular backups**:
- Before major operations
- After significant progress
- Use encrypted backups
- Test recovery process

### Organization

**File management**:
- Consistent naming conventions
- Folder structure
- Version control
- Archive completed cases

---

## Resources

**Documentation**: Review methodology papers for deep understanding

**Community**: Engage with other analysts for insights

**Training**: Seek formal training opportunities

**Updates**: Stay current with methodology refinements
