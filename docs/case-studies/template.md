## S.A.M. Analysis

### ANCHOR Phase: Premise Origins

#### Key Claims Analyzed
[List significant claims that were traced to origin]

#### Origin Assessment
| Claim | Origin Document | Origin Date | Origin Type | Evidential Quality | False Premise? |
|-------|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| | | | | | |

#### False Premises Identified
[Detailed description of false premises found, with evidence]

### INHERIT Phase: Propagation Patterns

#### Propagation Network
[Describe how claims propagated across documents and institutions]

#### Key Propagation Events
| Source Doc | Target Doc | Claim | Propagation Type | Verification? | Mutation Detected? |
|------------|-----------|-------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| | | | | | |

#### Mutations Detected
[Describe amplification, certainty drift, scope expansion, etc.]

#### Institutional Boundary Crossings
[Where claims crossed from one institution to another without verification]

### COMPOUND Phase: Authority Accumulation

#### Authority Markers
| Claim | Authority Document | Authority Type | Weight | Cumulative Score |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|--------|-----------------|
| | | | | |

#### Authority Laundering Detected
[Describe cases where low-evidence claims gained high authority]

#### Authority Laundering Paths
[Trace the path: speculation → professional → official → court]

### ARRIVE Phase: Outcome Linkage

#### Outcomes Analyzed
| Outcome | Date | Type | Harm Level |
|---------|------|------|-----------|
| | | | |

#### Causation Analysis
