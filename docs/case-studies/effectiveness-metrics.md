# Effectiveness Metrics

Measuring S.A.M. impact and validation framework.

---

## Purpose

Empirical assessment of:
- S.A.M. methodology reliability and validity
- Phronesis platform effectiveness
- Impact on institutional accountability

---

## Methodology Validation Metrics

### Construct Validity

**Inter-Rater Reliability**:
- Cohen's kappa for categorical judgments
- Target: κ > 0.7 (substantial agreement)
- Percent overlap for claim extraction
- Target: > 80% overlap

**Origin Type Classification**:
- Agreement with expert consensus
- Sensitivity and specificity
- Target: Sensitivity > 0.8, Specificity > 0.85

**Propagation Detection**:
- Edge agreement in propagation graphs
- Target: > 70% agreement
- Precision and recall metrics

**Authority Laundering Detection**:
- Agreement on laundering flags
- Target: κ > 0.6
- ROC analysis, AUC target: > 0.8

### Criterion Validity

**Predictive Validity**:
- Do S.A.M. findings predict institutional corrections?
- Do authority laundering detections predict exonerations?
- Correlation with oversight body findings

**Concurrent Validity**:
- Alignment with external failure indicators
- Agreement with independent audits
- Correlation with adverse inspection reports
