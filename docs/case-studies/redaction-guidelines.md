# Redaction Guidelines

Privacy protection and anonymization standards for case studies and published analyses.

---

## Core Principles

**Privacy First**: When in doubt, redact

**Minimum Necessary**: Share only information necessary for credibility and understanding

**Focus on Patterns**: Emphasize systemic issues over individual details

**Legal Compliance**: Follow applicable privacy laws (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA)

---

## What to Redact

### Always Redact

**Personal Identifiers**:
- Full names of non-public figures
- Social Security numbers
- Date of birth (use year only or age ranges)
- Addresses (city/state acceptable, not street address)
- Phone numbers and email addresses
- Account numbers

**Children**:
- Always use pseudonyms for minors
- Redact schools, daycare centers, specific locations
- Extra caution given vulnerability

**Medical Information**:
- Specific diagnoses (unless critical to analysis)
- Medical record numbers
- Treatment details (unless central to case)
- Provider names (unless public figures)

**Financial Information**:
- Bank accounts, credit cards
- Income (use ranges if necessary)
- Asset details

### Consider Redacting

**Public Figures**: May need less redaction but consider context and relevance

**Institutional Actors**: Redact line-level staff; may keep supervisors/officials if relevant to accountability

**Locations**: Specific addresses vs. general areas

**Dates**: Exact dates vs. relative timing (e.g., "three months later")

## Redaction Methods

### Pseudonymization

**Individuals**: Use consistent pseudonyms (e.g., "Parent A," "Dr. Smith," "Child B")

**Institutions**: "County Child Protective Services," "Regional Medical Center"

**Maintain Consistency**: Same entity = same pseudonym throughout

### Generalization

**Dates**: "Early 2023" instead of "March 15, 2023"

**Ages**: "Early 30s" instead of "32 years old"

**Locations**: "Midwestern city" instead of "Cleveland, OH"

### Aggregation

**Combine similar cases** to prevent identification through unique details

**Statistical reporting** rather than individual case details

---

## Document Redaction Process

### Step 1: Identify Information to Redact
- Review entire document
- Mark all PII and sensitive information
- Consider reidentification risk from combination of details

### Step 2: Apply Redaction
- **PDF**: Use proper redaction tools (not just black boxes)
- **Text**: Replace with pseudonyms or [REDACTED]
- **Structured Data**: Remove or pseudonymize fields

### Step 3: Review
- Can document still be understood?
- Is analysis still credible?
- Could person be reidentified?

### Step 4: Metadata
- Remove metadata from files (EXIF data, document properties)
- Strip revision history
- Clean file names

---

## Special Cases

### Court Records

Even public records may need redaction for:
- Victim privacy
- Children involved
- Sensitive details not legally required to share

### Medical Records

HIPAA compliance requires:
- De-identification per Safe Harbor method
- Or expert determination that reidentification risk is very small

### Journalistic Use

Balance public interest and privacy:
- Public officials: Less privacy expectation
- Private figures: Greater protection
- Newsworthy vs. gratuitous details

---

## Reidentification Risk Assessment

Consider combination of factors:
- Small population (rural area, rare profession)
- Unique details (unusual circumstances)
- Temporal specificity (exact dates)
- Public availability of related information

**K-anonymity**: Ensure at least K individuals share same attributes

---

## Case Study Publication Checklist

- [ ] All personal identifiers removed or pseudonymized
- [ ] Children's information fully anonymized
- [ ] Medical details de-identified
- [ ] Financial information removed
- [ ] Locations generalized appropriately
- [ ] Dates generalized where appropriate
- [ ] Consistent pseudonyms throughout
- [ ] Metadata stripped from files
- [ ] Reidentification risk assessed as low
- [ ] Legal review (if available)
- [ ] Ethical review (if applicable)
- [ ] Documented redaction decisions

---

## Balancing Credibility and Privacy

### Provide Sufficient Detail For:
- Understanding institutional failures
- Verifying analytical reasoning
- Assessing methodology quality
- Learning from patterns

### Without Compromising:
- Individual privacy
- Confidentiality obligations
- Safety or security
- Legal compliance

### Techniques:
- Focus on institutional actions, not personal details
- Quote documents without identifying individuals
- Use composite examples from multiple cases
- Emphasize patterns over particulars

---

## Legal Considerations

**Privilege**: Don't publish privileged information

**Protective Orders**: Comply with court orders

**Confidentiality Agreements**: Honor contractual obligations

**Defamation**: Ensure accuracy; opinion must be reasonable

**Copyright**: Properly attribute or fair use

---

## Institutional Redaction

### When to Name Institutions

**Consider naming** if:
- Public accountability requires it
- Institution is already publicly associated with case
- Pattern of failures across multiple cases
- Strong public interest

**Consider anonymizing** if:
- Pattern is generalizable
- Naming would enable individual identification
- Purely educational/methodological publication

---

## Documentation

**Maintain Unredacted Version**:
- Securely stored
- Access controlled
- For verification if challenged

**Document Redaction Decisions**:
- What was redacted and why
- Balancing factors considered
- Legal/ethical basis
