# Validation Reports

This directory contains results from formal validation studies of S.A.M. methodology.

---

## Purpose

Empirical validation of:
- Inter-rater reliability
- Construct validity
- Criterion validity
- Sensitivity and specificity
- Cross-domain applicability

---

## Planned Studies

### 1. Inter-Rater Reliability Study

**Objective**: Measure agreement between independent analysts applying S.A.M. to same cases.

**Metrics**:
- Cohen's kappa for categorical judgments
- Percent overlap for claim extraction
- Edge agreement for propagation graphs

**Target**: κ > 0.7 (substantial agreement)

**Status**: Planned

---

### 2. Predictive Validity Study

**Objective**: Test whether S.A.M. findings predict institutional corrections.

**Method**: Apply S.A.M. to historical cases with known outcomes (exonerations, reversals, reforms).

**Hypothesis**: High-severity findings correlate with subsequent corrections.

**Status**: Planned

---

### 3. Cross-Domain Validation

**Objective**: Assess S.A.M. applicability across domains (legal, medical, child protection).

**Method**: Apply methodology to cases in different domains; compare reliability and validity.

**Status**: Planned

---

### 4. Sensitivity/Specificity Analysis

**Objective**: Establish error rates for key classifications (false premise detection, authority laundering).

**Method**: Ground truth dataset with expert consensus; calculate sensitivity and specificity.

**Status**: Planned
