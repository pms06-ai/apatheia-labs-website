Platform vs Website

Platform (product codebase)
- src/ (React app)
- src-tauri/ (Rust/Tauri backend)
- packages/ (workspace packages)
- public/ (app static assets)
- scripts/ (dev utilities for platform + website tooling)
- docs/ (platform documentation, except docs/research moved under website/)

Website (marketing + research content)
- website/landing/ (static marketing site output)
- website/research/ (research markdown source)
- website/docs/research/ (foundations research markdown)

Separation intent
- Platform remains the primary build/test surface at repo root.
- Website content is now isolated under website/ to support a future split.
