# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- The repo root is the entire website. The landing page is `index.html` with global styles in `styles.css` and client logic in `app.js`.
- Research content is Markdown under `research/`. Pages are generated by `build.js` using templates in `templates/`.
- `research/metadata.json` and HTML under `research/**/index.html` are build outputs; treat them as generated files.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run build`: Generate HTML from Markdown, update `sitemap.xml`, and rebuild metadata.
- `npm run watch`: Rebuild on file changes during content editing.
- `npm run build:sitemap`: Regenerate the sitemap only.
- There is no separate test suite; use `npm run build` as the validation step.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Keep formatting consistent with existing files: 2-space indentation, single quotes in JS, and compact CSS declarations.
- Prefer descriptive, semantic class names (kebab-case). Avoid introducing CSS frameworks or utility systems not already in use.
- For new scripts, follow the current pattern of plain ES modules in `app.js`.

## Content & Template Workflow
- Every research article in `research/` must include YAML frontmatter with `title`, `description`, `category`, and `status`.
- Use `.md` links between research articles (the build script converts them to clean directory URLs).
- Do not edit generated HTML in `research/`; edit the source Markdown or templates instead.
- Asset paths in templates should be absolute (e.g., `/styles.css`, `/app.js`) for nested pages.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit history uses Conventional Commits (`type: subject`). Example: `feat: add markdown build pipeline`.
- Keep subjects lowercase and under ~72 characters.
- PRs should include a concise summary, any commands run (`npm run build`), and screenshots for visible UI changes.
