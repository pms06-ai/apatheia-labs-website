  "task_description": "# Complete Entity Resolution Engine\n\nImplement the entity_resolution analysis engine to identify and track the same entities (people, organizations, documents) across different naming conventions and references throughout a document corpus. Essential for connecting who said what where.\n\n## Rationale\nUsers cannot effectively trace accountability without knowing that 'Dr. Smith', 'John Smith', 'the evaluator', and 'the expert witness' all refer to the same person. This directly addresses the pain point of tracking false claims across documents where references vary. Manual review struggles with this (pain-5-4).\n\n## User Stories\n- As an investigative journalist, I want to automatically link references to the same person across different documents so that I can track their role in spreading misinformation\n- As a legal professional, I want to see all mentions of an entity across case documents so that I can build a complete evidence trail\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Engine identifies same entity across 5+ different naming variations\n- [ ] Confidence scores provided for entity matches\n- [ ] Users can confirm/reject entity linkages\n- [ ] Entity graph visualization shows connections across documents\n",
