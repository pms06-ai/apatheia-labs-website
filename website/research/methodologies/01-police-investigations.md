# Police Investigation Workflows - Professional Frameworks

## Executive Summary

Modern police investigations operate within rigorously structured professional frameworks that balance systematic methodology with investigative flexibility. This document synthesizes the core investigative doctrines, systems, and quality controls that define professional police investigation in the UK and internationally.

**Key Principle:** Investigation is fundamentally human. Systems must support investigative thinking, not replace it. Structure enables accountability while preserving the analytical judgment essential to effective investigation.

The UK's College of Policing Core Investigative Doctrine, built around the 5WH framework (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How), provides the conceptual foundation. This is operationalized through the Professionalising Investigation Programme (PIP), which stratifies investigative competence across four levels. Major incident investigations leverage HOLMES2 case management systems and multi-agency coordination protocols, while evidence collection adheres to internationally recognized chain of custody standards.

Critical to this framework is the legal architecture governing investigation: the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) governs arrests, detention, and interviews; the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (CPIA) mandates disclosure of all material evidence, including that which undermines the prosecution case. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) provides external oversight and investigation standards for serious incidents.

**Core Insight:** Professional investigation requires both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence gathering. CPIA obligations demand pursuit of "reasonable lines of enquiry" both towards AND away from the suspect—a principle that distinguishes professional investigation from advocacy.

## 1. Core Investigation Framework

### 1.1 The 5WH Framework (College of Policing Core Investigative Doctrine)

The 5WH model structures investigative thinking across six fundamental dimensions:

- **What** happened? (Event reconstruction, offence classification)
- **Who** was involved? (Victims, suspects, witnesses, accomplices)
- **When** did it occur? (Timeline establishment, sequence reconstruction)
- **Where** did it take place? (Crime scene, secondary locations, digital spaces)
- **Why** did it happen? (Motivation, context, contributory factors)
- **How** was it committed? (Methods, tools, techniques, modus operandi)

This framework drives hypothesis generation, evidence prioritization, and investigative planning. Every investigative action should advance understanding of one or more 5WH dimensions.

### 1.2 Professionalising Investigation Programme (PIP)

PIP establishes a four-tier competency structure for investigators:

**PIP Level 1 - Volume Crime Investigators**
- Initial responders and patrol officers
- Routine crime investigation (burglary, theft, criminal damage)
- Evidence preservation and scene management
- Witness identification and initial accounts
- Basic investigative decision-making

**PIP Level 2 - Serious Crime Investigators**
- Complex crime investigation (serious assault, rape, robbery)
- Advanced interview techniques
- Multi-source evidence coordination
- Investigation planning and management
- Supervision of PIP Level 1 investigations

**PIP Level 3 - Senior Investigating Officers (SIO)**
- Major incident investigation (homicide, terrorism, organized crime)
- HOLMES2 system management
- Multi-agency coordination
- Strategic investigative decision-making
- Major Incident Room (MIR) leadership
- Prosecution file preparation for complex cases

**PIP Level 4 - Strategic Managers**
- Oversight of multiple major investigations
- Resource allocation and strategic planning
- Policy development and quality assurance
- Interagency liaison at strategic level
- Review and learning from completed investigations

### 1.3 Investigative Principles

**Primacy of Material**
All investigative conclusions must be supported by material evidence. Speculation and assumption are explicitly identified and tested.

**Reasonable Lines of Enquiry**
CPIA requires investigators to pursue all reasonable lines of enquiry, whether they point towards or away from the suspect. This is not merely a legal obligation but a methodological imperative: robust conclusions require testing counter-hypotheses.

**Objective Evidence Evaluation**
Confirmation bias is the primary threat to investigative integrity. Professional investigation demands systematic consideration of alternative explanations and evidence that contradicts working hypotheses.

**Documentation and Audit Trail**
Every investigative action, decision, and rationale must be documented contemporaneously. This supports accountability, continuity (when investigators change), and legal scrutiny.

## 2. Interview Methodologies

### 2.1 PEACE Model (UK National Standard)

PEACE is the UK's evidence-based interview framework, internationally adopted and rooted in cognitive psychology rather than coercive tactics.

**P - Planning and Preparation**
- Review all available evidence
- Identify information gaps
- Develop interview strategy and topics
- Prepare questions (open-ended, not leading)
- Consider interviewee vulnerability and special measures
- Arrange appropriate environment and support

**E - Engage and Explain**
- Establish rapport (essential for cognitive function)
- Explain interview process and legal rights
- Address interviewee concerns
- Create psychologically safe environment
- Clarify expectations and outcomes

**A - Account, Clarify, Challenge**
- Obtain free narrative account (uninterrupted)
- Clarify ambiguities and timeline
- Probe for detail using open questions
- Challenge inconsistencies and contradictions
- Present evidence strategically
- Allow interviewee to explain discrepancies

**C - Closure**
- Summarize key points
- Allow interviewee to add or clarify
- Explain next steps
- Maintain rapport (future cooperation)
- Thank interviewee for participation

**E - Evaluation**
- Assess account against evidence
- Identify corroboration opportunities
- Determine further investigative actions
- Document interview outcomes and decisions
- Review interviewer performance and techniques

**Evidence Base:** PEACE interviews produce more reliable evidence than confrontational methods. The model reduces false confessions while increasing voluntary admissions.

### 2.2 Cognitive Interview Technique

Developed by Fisher and Geiselman (1992), the Cognitive Interview leverages memory science to enhance witness recall.

**Performance:** 46% increase in correct recall compared to standard interviews, with 90% accuracy maintained.

**Four Core Techniques:**

1. **Context Reinstatement**
   - Mentally recreate physical environment
   - Recall emotional state at time of event
   - Recall thoughts and sensations
   - Use environmental cues (sounds, smells, lighting)
   - *Rationale:* Memory is context-dependent; reinstating context activates related neural pathways

2. **Report Everything**
   - Encourage reporting all details, even if seemingly irrelevant
   - No self-editing or filtering
   - Include partial information and impressions
   - *Rationale:* Seemingly trivial details can trigger associated memories or provide investigative leads

3. **Recall from Different Perspectives**
   - Describe events from another person's viewpoint
   - Consider what others present might have observed
   - *Caution:* Clearly distinguish observed fact from inference
   - *Rationale:* Different perspectives access different memory traces

4. **Recall in Different Orders**
   - Reverse chronological order
   - Start from most memorable point
   - Vary sequence of recall
   - *Rationale:* Disrupts script-based recall, accesses episodic memory

**Application:** Used primarily with cooperative witnesses (not suspects). Requires trained interviewers and extended time (typically 60-90 minutes).

### 2.3 Achieving Best Evidence (ABE)

ABE is the UK framework for interviewing vulnerable and intimidated witnesses, particularly children and adults with learning difficulties.

**Key Principles:**
- Pre-interview assessment of vulnerability and communication needs
- Specialist trained interviewers
- Video recording (admissible as evidence-in-chief)
- Phased approach with extensive rapport-building
- Communication aids (visual aids, intermediaries)
- Questions matched to developmental level
- Avoidance of repeated interviews (retraumatization)

**Phases:**
1. **Establishing rapport** (extended phase, building trust)
2. **Free narrative** (minimize interruptions)
3. **Questioning** (open questions, visual aids)
4. **Closure** (neutral topics, explain process)

**Legal Framework:** Video interviews can replace live testimony under Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, reducing trauma and improving evidence quality.

### 2.4 Reid Technique (US Context - Included for Contrast)

**Important Caveat:** The Reid Technique is controversial and has been linked to false confessions.

**Structure:**
- Nine-step confrontational interview
- Presumption of guilt
- Behavioral analysis (scientifically discredited)
- Minimization and maximization tactics
- Theme development (providing justifications)

**Criticism:**
- 25% of DNA exonerations involved false confessions
- Disproportionately affects vulnerable suspects (juveniles, intellectual disabilities)
- Creates compliance rather than truth-seeking
- Not evidence-based

**Relevance:** Understanding Reid is important for recognizing its limitations and appreciating why evidence-based models (PEACE, Cognitive Interview) are superior.

## 6. Legal Framework

### 6.1 Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE)

PACE governs police powers and safeguards for suspects and witnesses.

**Key Provisions:**

**Arrest (Section 24):**
- Necessity test: arrest only if necessary for investigation
- Grounds: reasonable suspicion of involvement in offence
- Rights: caution, notification of reason for arrest

**Detention (Sections 37-46):**
- Custody officer independence (not involved in investigation)
- Detention reviews (6 hours, then 9 hours, then magistrates' court)
- Maximum pre-charge detention: 24 hours (36 hours for indictable offences, 96 hours for terrorism)
- Conditions of detention (meals, rest, medical care)

**Interviews (Code C):**
- Caution required
- Right to legal advice (free, independent)
- Appropriate adult for juveniles and vulnerable persons
- Audio/video recording mandatory
- No oppressive conduct
- Regular breaks

**Search and Seizure (Sections 8, 18, 19, 32):**
- Warrant requirements for premises search
- Powers to search person on arrest
- Seizure of evidence relevant to offence
- Return of seized property if not required

**Samples (Sections 61-65):**
- Intimate samples require consent (except DNA in serious cases)
- Non-intimate samples without consent if arrested for recordable offence
- Destruction rules (if not convicted)

**PACE Codes of Practice:**
- Code A: Stop and search
- Code B: Search of premises
- Code C: Detention, treatment, questioning
- Code D: Identification procedures
- Code E: Audio recording
- Code F: Video recording
- Code G: Arrest
- Code H: Terrorism detention

### 6.2 Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (CPIA)

CPIA establishes disclosure obligations and imposes investigative discipline.

**Disclosure Obligations:**

**Prosecution Duty:**
- Disclose all material that might reasonably be considered capable of undermining the prosecution case or assisting the defence case
- Not limited to admissible evidence
- Includes material that weakens prosecution or strengthens defence
- Continuing duty (obligation survives up to and during trial)

**Defence Statement:**
- Defence must provide statement of defence case
- Identifies issues in dispute
- Sets out alibis and defence witnesses
- Triggers secondary disclosure obligation

**Unused Material:**
- Investigator duty to record and retain all material obtained
- Disclosure Officer duty to review and schedule
- Prosecutor duty to assess and disclose
- Sanctions for non-disclosure (case dismissal, conviction overturn)

**Reasonable Lines of Enquiry:**
- Positive obligation to pursue enquiries that undermine prosecution case
- Not merely reactive to defence requests
- Documented rationale for not pursuing potential lines of enquiry
- Subject to judicial review

**Code of Practice:**
- Material definition: anything obtained in investigation
- Recording requirements: contemporaneous logs
- Retention requirements: until case closed and appeals exhausted
- Disclosure schedule: lists all material with sensitivity assessments
- Public Interest Immunity (PII) for sensitive material

**Key Principle:** CPIA reflects the adversarial system's fairness imperative. The state's superior investigative resources impose a corresponding obligation to disclose material that assists the accused.

## 10. Practical Application Examples

### 10.1 Volume Crime Investigation (PIP Level 1)

**Scenario:** Residential burglary, forced entry, property stolen.

**5WH Application:**
- **What:** Burglary dwelling, multiple rooms searched, jewelry and electronics stolen
- **Who:** Unknown suspect(s), householder victim, neighbor witness
- **When:** Between 09:00-17:00 on [date] (householder at work)
- **Where:** [Address], rear door forced
- **Why:** Financial gain (targeted valuable items)
- **How:** Forced rear door with crowbar, methodical search

**Investigation Actions:**
- Scene examination: forced entry marks photographed, fingerprint examination
- House-to-house enquiries: neighbor CCTV canvass
- Intelligence checks: similar MO burglaries in area
- Victim statement: property list, recent suspicious activity
- CCTV review: local authority and private cameras
- Pawn shop/online marketplace monitoring for stolen goods

**Evidence Assessment:**
- Fingerprints: checked against database
- CCTV: vehicle identified near scene at relevant time
- Intelligence: linked to three similar burglaries (MO match)
- Forensic: DNA from blood on broken glass at entry point

**Outcome:** Suspect identified from DNA match, arrested, charged with four burglaries, convicted.

**Learning:** Systematic scene examination and intelligence linking enabled series detection. Single DNA hit solved multiple offences.

### 10.2 Major Incident Investigation (PIP Level 3)

**Scenario:** Suspicious death, body discovered in woodland.

**Initial Response:**
- Scene preservation: 500m cordon, scene guard, log established
- SIO appointment: PIP Level 3 qualified detective chief inspector
- HOLMES2 activation: case created, team assigned
- MIR established: physical location, staffing, equipment
- Post-mortem: Home Office pathologist attended scene and conducted examination

**5WH Framework:**
- **What:** Death by strangulation (post-mortem finding)
- **Who:** Victim identified via fingerprints, no suspect initially
- **When:** Death estimated 48-72 hours before discovery
- **Where:** Secondary crime scene (body moved), primary scene unknown
- **Why:** Unknown (no obvious motive, no robbery, sexual assault ruled out)
- **How:** Manual strangulation, significant force, probable male assailant

**Investigation Strategy:**
- Victimology: full background investigation, relationships, lifestyle, risks
- Last sighting: witness appeals, CCTV from last confirmed location
- Communications: phone records (cell site, calls, messages)
- Financial: bank records, transactions around time of death
- Associates: interview all known contacts
- Forensic: DNA, fiber analysis, entomology (time of death refinement)
- Intelligence: criminal associates, threats, disputes

**Key Breakthrough:**
- Cell site analysis placed victim's phone in specific area at time of death
- CCTV from that area showed victim with male
- Male identified via vehicle registration
- Male's phone also cell-sited to same location
- Male initially denied contact, confronted with evidence, admitted meeting but claimed victim alive when left
- Forensic: victim's DNA found in male's vehicle
- Re-interview: partial admission, claimed argument, victim fell and hit head
- Post-mortem inconsistent with fall (strangulation clear)
- Full confession obtained after forensic evidence presented

**Outcome:** Conviction for murder.

**Learning:** Cell site analysis provided investigative direction. Forensic evidence contradicted suspect account, facilitating confession. HOLMES2 system enabled integration of multiple evidence sources.

### 10.3 Vulnerable Witness Interview (ABE)

**Scenario:** Child witness to domestic violence.

**Preparation:**
- Child development specialist consulted
- Pre-interview assessment: communication level, trauma response
- Rapport-building session (separate from evidential interview)
- Visual aids prepared (house layout diagram, timeline cards)
- Specialist interviewer and supporter assigned
- Video recording equipment tested

**Interview Conduct:**
- Extended rapport phase: neutral topics, favorite activities, school
- Ground rules explained: "I wasn't there, so I need you to tell me everything"
- Free narrative: "Tell me what happened"
- Open questions: "What happened next?" "Where were you?"
- Minimal interruptions: child-led pace
- Visual aids: child placed figures on house diagram
- Closure: return to neutral topics, explain next steps

**Evidence Quality:**
- Child's account clear and consistent
- Video admissible as evidence-in-chief (no live testimony required)
- Defendant pled guilty after viewing video interview (spared child cross-examination)

**Learning:** Specialist interviewing and video recording enabled child's evidence to be heard without retraumatization. Guilty plea saved child from trial.

## 11. Key Takeaways for System Design

### 11.1 Human-Centered Design

**Principle:** Systems must augment investigative thinking, not replace it.

**Implementation:**
- Present evidence, don't interpret
- Surface contradictions and gaps, don't draw conclusions
- Enable hypothesis testing, don't prescribe hypotheses
- Support documentation, don't impose rigid workflows
- Facilitate analytical reasoning, don't automate judgment

### 11.2 Accountability and Audit

**Principle:** Every action and decision must be documented and defensible.

**Implementation:**
- Comprehensive logging (who, what, when, why)
- Decision rationale capture (not just outcomes)
- Version control for evolving assessments
- Chain of custody for evidence
- Access controls and audit trails

### 11.3 Balanced Investigation

**Principle:** Pursue evidence both towards and away from hypotheses.

**Implementation:**
- Surface exculpatory evidence prominently
- Flag confirmation bias risks
- Require documented consideration of alternative explanations
- Track evidence for and against each hypothesis
- Disclosure schedules generated automatically

### 11.4 Quality Control Integration

**Principle:** Build review and oversight into workflow, not as afterthought.

**Implementation:**
- Supervisor approval gates at key decision points
- Peer review of analytical products
- Consistency checks (timeline contradictions, evidence gaps)
- Compliance monitoring (PACE, CPIA, interview standards)
- Learning loops (post-case review feeding training and policy)

### 11.5 Evidence Integrity

**Principle:** Maintain evidential value from collection to court.

**Implementation:**
- Digital chain of custody (immutable logs)
- Hash verification for digital evidence
- Access controls and tamper detection
- Metadata preservation
- Export formats compatible with legal requirements

### 11.6 Scalability and Complexity Management

**Principle:** System must handle volume crime and major incidents.

**Implementation:**
- Modular architecture (activate features based on case complexity)
- HOLMES2-like linking and analysis for major cases
- Lightweight workflows for routine cases
- Multi-user coordination for team investigations
- Integration with external systems (forensics, intelligence, CPS)

### 11.7 Trauma-Informed Approach

**Principle:** Recognize impact of investigation on victims and witnesses.

**Implementation:**
- Special measures flagging and tracking
- Victim communication logs
- Witness care integration
- ABE interview support tools
- Minimization of repeat interviews/testimony
