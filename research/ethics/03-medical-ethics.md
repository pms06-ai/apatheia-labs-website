# Medical Ethics and the Four Principles

## Introduction

Medical ethics in contemporary practice is dominated by the "four principles" framework articulated by Tom Beauchamp and James Childress in their seminal work *Principles of Biomedical Ethics* (1979, now in its 8th edition). This framework provides a systematic approach to ethical reasoning in healthcare, balancing respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. While developed in an American context, the four principles have been widely adopted in UK medical practice, incorporated into General Medical Council (GMC) guidance, and referenced extensively in case law.

This article examines each principle in detail, explores tensions between them, and analyses their application to medical evidence in legal proceedings. Understanding these principles is essential for evaluating whether medical professionals have adhered to ethical standards when providing expert evidence, conducting assessments, or making treatment recommendations.

## The Four Principles Framework

### Historical Development

Beauchamp and Childress developed their framework in response to the need for a common moral language in medical ethics that could bridge diverse philosophical traditions. Rather than advocating a single ethical theory (such as utilitarianism or deontology), they proposed four mid-level principles that could command broad agreement across different moral frameworks.

The four principles approach gained prominence in the UK through the work of Raanan Gillon, who argued that these principles, supplemented by attention to scope, could provide a comprehensive framework for medical ethics (Gillon, 1994). The approach has been criticised for potential superficiality and for failing to provide clear guidance when principles conflict (K Danner Clouser and Bernard Gert, 1990), but remains the dominant framework in UK medical education and professional guidance.

### The Principles Defined

**Autonomy**: Respect for the decision-making capacities of autonomous persons, including their right to hold views, make choices, and take actions based on personal values and beliefs.

**Beneficence**: The obligation to act for the benefit of others, promoting their wellbeing and best interests.

**Non-maleficence**: The obligation to avoid causing harm, often summarised in the Hippocratic principle "first, do no harm" (*primum non nocere*).

**Justice**: Fair distribution of benefits, risks, and costs, encompassing both distributive justice (allocation of resources) and rights-based justice (respect for people's rights).

## Autonomy and Informed Consent

### The Principle of Autonomy

Respect for autonomy requires that medical professionals recognise patients as self-determining agents capable of making their own decisions. This principle underlies the legal and ethical requirement for informed consent before medical treatment. As Lord Scarman stated in *Sidaway v Board of Governors of the Bethlem Royal Hospital* [1985] AC 871:

> "The right of 'self-determination' – the right of a patient to determine for himself whether he will or will not accept the doctor's advice – is vested in the patient."

Autonomy is not absolute. It requires decision-making capacity, adequate information, and freedom from coercion. The principle applies to competent adults; different considerations apply to children and adults lacking capacity.

### Informed Consent Requirements

The UK Supreme Court in *Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board* [2015] UKSC 11 established that doctors must inform patients of "material risks" – those a reasonable person in the patient's position would be likely to attach significance to, or those the doctor is aware or should reasonably be aware the particular patient would be likely to attach significance to.

This represents a shift from the earlier *Bolam* test (which assessed disclosure by reference to responsible medical practice) to a patient-centred standard. Lord Kerr and Lord Reed stated:

> "An adult person of sound mind is entitled to decide which, if any, of the available forms of treatment to undergo, and her consent must be obtained before treatment interfering with her bodily integrity is undertaken. The doctor is therefore under a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that the patient is aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments."

### Capacity Assessment

The Mental Capacity Act 2005 provides the statutory framework for determining whether an adult has capacity to make a particular decision. A person lacks capacity if they are unable to:

1. Understand information relevant to the decision
2. Retain that information
3. Use or weigh that information as part of the decision-making process
4. Communicate the decision

Crucially, capacity is decision-specific and time-specific. A person may have capacity for some decisions but not others, and capacity may fluctuate. The Act establishes a presumption of capacity (s.1(2)) and requires that a person not be treated as unable to make a decision "unless all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success" (s.1(3)).

### Refusal of Treatment

Competent adults have an absolute right to refuse medical treatment, even where that refusal may result in death. In *Re T (Adult: Refusal of Treatment)* [1993] Fam 95, Lord Donaldson MR stated:

> "An adult patient who...suffers from no mental incapacity has an absolute right to choose whether to consent to medical treatment, to refuse it or to choose one rather than another of the treatments being offered."

This right extends to advance decisions to refuse treatment (sometimes called "living wills"), which are given statutory force under the Mental Capacity Act 2005, ss.24-26.

## Beneficence and Non-Maleficence

### The Obligation to Benefit

Beneficence requires doctors to act in their patients' best interests, promoting their health and wellbeing. This principle underlies the doctor's duty of care and informs treatment decisions where patients lack capacity.

The Mental Capacity Act 2005 requires decision-makers to act in the best interests of patients lacking capacity (s.1(5), s.4). Best interests is not limited to medical best interests but encompasses a holistic assessment including:

- The person's past and present wishes and feelings
- Beliefs and values that would influence the decision if they had capacity
- Other factors the person would consider if able to do so
- Views of family members and others interested in the person's welfare

### The Primacy of Non-Maleficence

Non-maleficence is often accorded priority over beneficence on the grounds that the obligation not to harm is stronger than the obligation to benefit. However, almost all medical interventions carry some risk of harm, requiring a risk-benefit analysis.

The principle is violated when:

- Harm is inflicted without medical justification
- Risks are not adequately disclosed
- Treatment continues despite evidence it is causing more harm than benefit
- Decisions are made negligently, falling below reasonable standards of care

### Risk-Benefit Analysis

Medical decision-making requires balancing potential benefits against potential harms. This analysis must be:

- **Evidence-based**: Grounded in scientific evidence about efficacy and safety
- **Proportionate**: Significant risks justified only by significant potential benefits
- **Individualised**: Accounting for the particular patient's circumstances and values
- **Transparent**: Communicated clearly to patients (or those with parental responsibility)

In *Re A (Children)* [2001] Fam 147 (the conjoined twins case), the Court of Appeal held that surgery to separate conjoined twins was lawful despite certainty it would cause the death of the weaker twin, because it was the only chance of saving the stronger twin and the weaker twin would die imminently in any event.

### Paternalism and its Limits

Paternalism involves overriding a person's preferences for their own good. "Hard" paternalism overrides the choices of competent adults; "soft" paternalism involves intervention where capacity is questionable or to ensure decisions are truly autonomous.

Hard paternalism is generally impermissible in UK medical law. The *Montgomery* decision explicitly rejected paternalistic approaches to information disclosure:

> "The doctor's advisory role involves dialogue, the aim of which is to ensure that the patient understands the seriousness of her condition, and the anticipated benefits and risks of the proposed treatment and any reasonable alternatives, so that she is then in a position to make an informed decision."

However, elements of soft paternalism remain legitimate - for example, assessing capacity before accepting a treatment refusal, or treating under the Mental Health Act 1983 where statutory criteria are met.

## Justice and Resource Allocation

### Distributive Justice in Healthcare

Justice in healthcare raises questions about the fair allocation of finite resources. Several theories of distributive justice compete:

**Egalitarian**: Equal access to healthcare for all
**Utilitarian**: Maximise overall health benefit
**Prioritarian**: Priority to the worst-off
**Libertarian**: Distribution according to ability to pay or free choice

The NHS embodies a broadly egalitarian commitment to healthcare free at the point of delivery, but operates within resource constraints requiring rationing decisions. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) uses cost-effectiveness analysis (typically cost per quality-adjusted life year, or QALY) to determine which treatments the NHS should fund.

### Rights-Based Justice

Justice also encompasses respect for rights. Relevant rights include:

- **Right to life** (ECHR Article 2): Imposes positive obligations on healthcare providers in some circumstances
- **Right to respect for private life** (ECHR Article 8): Encompasses bodily integrity and decisional autonomy
- **Right not to be discriminated against** (ECHR Article 14, Equality Act 2010): Protected characteristics must not lead to unjustified differential treatment

### Triage and Priority-Setting

Emergency medicine and intensive care require triage decisions about which patients to treat first. Ethically defensible triage should be:

- **Needs-based**: Priority to those with greatest medical need
- **Benefit-based**: Priority to those most likely to benefit
- **Fair**: Not discriminating based on irrelevant factors
- **Transparent**: Using clear, publicly defensible criteria

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted tensions between these considerations, particularly regarding age-based rationing and resource allocation during capacity constraints.

## Confidentiality and Information Sharing

### The Duty of Confidentiality

Confidentiality is a fundamental principle of medical ethics, rooted in respect for autonomy and necessary for the trust underpinning the doctor-patient relationship. The GMC states:

> "Patients have a right to expect that information about them will be held in confidence by their doctors. Confidentiality is central to trust between doctors and patients. Without assurances about confidentiality, patients may be reluctant to seek medical attention or to give doctors the information they need in order to provide good care." (*Confidentiality: good practice in handling patient information*, 2017)

Confidentiality is protected in:

- **Common law**: Breach of confidence tort
- **Contract**: Express or implied terms
- **Statute**: Data Protection Act 2018, implementing UK GDPR
- **Human rights law**: ECHR Article 8
- **Professional regulation**: GMC, NMC, HCPC standards

### Exceptions and Limits

Confidentiality is not absolute. Disclosure without consent may be justified where:

1. **Required by law**: Court orders, statutory notification requirements (e.g., notifiable diseases)
2. **Public interest**: Prevention or detection of serious crime, protection of others from serious harm
3. **Patient safety**: Concerns about fitness to drive, child protection
4. **Implicit consent**: Within the healthcare team for treatment purposes

The GMC guidance requires doctors to:

- Inform patients about likely disclosures
- Anonymise information where possible
- Keep disclosures to the minimum necessary
- Document the decision and justification for disclosure

### Confidentiality in Legal Proceedings

Medical professionals providing expert evidence face particular confidentiality challenges. Generally:

- **Instructed expert**: Disclosure authorised by the party instructing (who has obtained patient consent or court order)
- **Treating clinician as witness**: May be compelled by court order (though should resist disclosure without order)
- **Court-appointed expert**: Disclosure authorised by court order

Experts must not go beyond their instructions in accessing patient records and should redact information not relevant to the issues in the case.

## Conflicts Between Principles

### When Principles Collide

The four principles do not provide a hierarchy or algorithm for resolution when they conflict. Beauchamp and Childress advocate "specification" (making principles more concrete for particular contexts) and "balancing" (weighing competing considerations in specific cases).

Common conflicts include:

**Autonomy vs Beneficence**: Patient refuses treatment doctor believes is in their best interests
**Beneficence vs Non-maleficence**: Treatment offers potential benefit but significant risk
**Autonomy vs Justice**: Patient demands treatment of marginal benefit, consuming scarce resources
**Confidentiality vs Public Interest**: Disclosure to protect third parties

### Case Study: End-of-Life Decision-Making

End-of-life decisions epitomise conflicts between principles. Consider withdrawal of clinically assisted nutrition and hydration (CANH) from patients in permanent vegetative state.

In *Airedale NHS Trust v Bland* [1993] AC 789, the House of Lords held that withdrawing CANH from Anthony Bland (in persistent vegetative state after Hillsborough) was lawful because:

- Continued treatment was not in his best interests (beneficence)
- Treatment was futile and prolonged dying (non-maleficence)
- He lacked capacity to decide, so his previously expressed wishes were considered (autonomy)

Lord Goff distinguished acts (killing, impermissible) from omissions (allowing to die, permissible in some circumstances), though this distinction has been criticised.

The Mental Capacity Act 2005, s.4(5) requires consulting advance decisions and considering the person's past and present wishes. The Supreme Court in *Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust v James* [2013] UKSC 67 confirmed that best interests assessment must focus on the patient's perspective, not the clinician's view of worthwhile life.

### Case Study: Refusal of Treatment for Children

Conflicts between parental autonomy and child welfare arise when parents refuse treatment. The Children Act 1989, s.1 makes the child's welfare paramount. Courts can override parental refusal where treatment is in the child's best interests.

In *Re T (A Minor)* [1997] 1 WLR 242, parents refused a liver transplant for their child on grounds including the invasiveness of treatment and low success rates. The Court of Appeal upheld their refusal, holding that parental views carried significant weight and the court should not impose treatment where dedicated parents opposed it, unless clear evidence supported it.

Contrast *Re A (Children)* [2001] Fam 147, where the Court of Appeal authorised separation surgery despite parental opposition, because it was the only chance of saving one twin's life.

The balance depends on:

- Severity of harm from non-treatment
- Likelihood of treatment success
- Invasiveness and burden of treatment
- Child's own wishes (if of sufficient age and understanding)

### Case Study: Resource Allocation

Justice principle conflicts with autonomy and beneficence arise in resource allocation. In *R v Cambridge Health Authority ex parte B* [1995] 1 WLR 898, the Court of Appeal refused to order funding for experimental leukaemia treatment for a child, holding that:

- Courts should not interfere with resource allocation decisions absent irrationality
- Health authorities must balance competing claims on finite resources
- Experimental treatment with low success chance did not make refusal irrational

The case illustrates that individual beneficence must be balanced against justice considerations of fair resource distribution across all patients.

## Medical Ethics in Expert Evidence

### Expert Duties and Ethical Standards

Medical experts in legal proceedings owe duties to the court that may conflict with normal clinical obligations. The expert's primary duty is to the court, not the instructing party (CPR 35.3, FPR 25.13).

Ethical issues include:

**Scope of Practice**: Experts must work within their competence (GMC, *Good Medical Practice*, para 15)
**Impartiality**: Must not advocate for the party instructing them
**Evidence-Based Opinion**: Opinions must be supported by evidence, not speculation
**Limitations**: Must state limitations, uncertainties, and matters outside expertise
**Confidentiality**: Must respect patient confidentiality subject to court authorisation

### Autonomy in Assessment

When conducting assessments, medical experts must respect autonomy by:

- Explaining the purpose and process of assessment
- Clarifying the expert's role (not treating doctor)
- Explaining how information will be used
- Obtaining consent (or proceeding under court order if consent refused)
- Respecting reasonable refusals to answer questions

Failure to respect autonomy may invalidate the assessment or breach professional standards.

### Beneficence and Non-Maleficence in Expert Work

Experts must avoid harm by:

- Not conducting unnecessary examinations
- Using validated assessment tools
- Avoiding re-traumatisation (e.g., repeated recounting of abuse)
- Considering the emotional impact of assessment
- Signposting support services where appropriate

The obligation to benefit the assessee is limited (they are not the expert's patient), but experts should avoid gratuitous harm.

### Justice in Expert Evidence

Justice requires that expert evidence be:

- **Accessible**: Available to parties regardless of means (legal aid provisions)
- **Balanced**: Not systematically favouring one type of party
- **Evidence-based**: Not reflecting personal biases or assumptions
- **Transparent**: Methodology and reasoning clearly explained

Experts who consistently favour one party type (e.g., local authorities in care proceedings) may violate justice principles.

### Common Ethical Breaches

Professional conduct concerns in expert evidence include:

**Exceeding Instructions**: Offering opinions beyond the questions posed
**Advocacy**: Acting as partisan advocates rather than impartial experts
**Inadequate Evidence**: Reaching conclusions unsupported by available evidence
**Methodology Failures**: Using invalidated tools or inappropriate methods
**Certainty Overstatement**: Expressing unwarranted certainty about contested matters
**Selective Reporting**: Omitting relevant information that undermines opinion

These may breach GMC standards, particularly:

- Para 15 (working within competence)
- Para 21 (keeping knowledge and skills up to date)
- Para 65 (being honest and trustworthy)
- Para 71 (providing expert evidence only within competence)

## Capacity, Consent, and Best Interests

### The Mental Capacity Act Framework

The Mental Capacity Act 2005 operationalises respect for autonomy while providing a framework for decision-making where capacity is lacking. The five statutory principles (s.1) are:

1. **Presumption of capacity**: A person must be assumed to have capacity unless established otherwise
2. **Support to make decisions**: All practicable steps must be taken to help the person decide
3. **Unwise decisions**: A person is not to be treated as lacking capacity merely because they make an unwise decision
4. **Best interests**: Acts done for a person lacking capacity must be in their best interests
5. **Least restrictive option**: Consideration must be given to whether the purpose can be achieved in a less restrictive way

### Capacity Assessment Methodology

Capacity assessment under the Act requires:

**Stage 1 - Diagnostic Test**: Is there an impairment of, or disturbance in the functioning of, the person's mind or brain (temporary or permanent)?

**Stage 2 - Functional Test**: If yes, does the impairment/disturbance mean the person is unable to:
- Understand relevant information
- Retain that information
- Use or weigh that information
- Communicate the decision

Capacity is decision-specific. The Supreme Court in *PC v City of York Council* [2013] UKSC 34 held that capacity to consent to sexual relations is decision- and person-specific, requiring capacity to understand:

- The mechanics of the sexual act
- That the other person must consent
- That they have a choice about participating

### Best Interests Decision-Making

Where a person lacks capacity, the decision-maker must consider (MCA 2005, s.4):

- Whether and when the person might regain capacity
- The person's past and present wishes and feelings (especially written statements)
- The beliefs and values that would influence them if they had capacity
- Other factors the person would consider
- Views of family, carers, and others interested in their welfare
- Views of any attorney or deputy

Best interests is not about what others think is best, but about what the person would have wanted. Lady Hale in *Aintree* stated:

> "The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view."

### Deprivation of Liberty

The Mental Capacity Act 2005, Schedule A1 (inserted by Mental Health Act 2007) provides safeguards for deprivation of liberty (DoL) in hospitals and care homes. The Supreme Court in *P v Cheshire West and Chester Council* [2014] UKSC 19 held that a person is deprived of liberty if:

- Subject to continuous supervision and control, and
- Not free to leave

This is assessed objectively; the person's compliance or lack of objection is irrelevant. "Gilded cages" can still be cages.

Liberty Protection Safeguards (LPS), enacted in the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Act 2019 but not yet implemented, are intended to replace DoLS with a more proportionate system.

## Application to Professional Conduct Review

### Evaluating Medical Expert Evidence

When reviewing medical expert evidence for professional conduct issues, consider:

**Autonomy Violations**:
- Was consent properly obtained for assessment?
- Were limitations of confidentiality explained?
- Was the person's right to refuse participation respected?

**Beneficence/Non-Maleficence**:
- Was the assessment methodology appropriate and proportionate?
- Were unnecessary or harmful procedures avoided?
- Was the person treated with dignity and respect?

**Justice Issues**:
- Did the expert work within their competence?
- Was the methodology scientifically sound?
- Were opinions balanced and evidence-based?
- Were limitations clearly stated?

**Capacity Assessment**:
- Was the two-stage test properly applied?
- Was capacity assumed unless demonstrated otherwise?
- Were practicable steps taken to support decision-making?
- Was assessment decision-specific?

### Red Flags for Ethical Breaches

Indicators of potential ethical breaches include:

- Opinions offered outside area of expertise
- Conclusions reached without adequate evidence
- Failure to acknowledge limitations or uncertainties
- Advocacy for one party rather than impartial analysis
- Inconsistencies between cases suggesting bias
- Failure to consider alternative explanations
- Inadequate reasoning connecting evidence to conclusions
- Overstatement of certainty on contested matters
- Selective citation of literature or evidence
- Methodology departing from professional standards without justification

### Standards for Review

Medical experts' conduct is evaluated against:

- **GMC Standards**: *Good Medical Practice* (2024), *Acting as a Witness in Legal Proceedings* (2013)
- **Professional Body Guidance**: Royal College guidance for specialties
- **Legal Standards**: CPR 35 (civil), FPR 25 (family), CrimPR 19 (criminal)
- **Best Practice Guidance**: Family Justice Council Guidelines on Expert Evidence

Serious or persistent breaches may justify referral to the GMC for fitness to practise investigation.

## Connection to Phronesis Platform

The Phronesis Platform's analysis engines directly engage with medical ethics principles:

### Professional Conduct Engine (Π)

Tracks medical experts across cases to identify:

- **Scope violations**: Opinions outside competence boundaries (autonomy/beneficence)
- **Methodology failures**: Non-evidence-based approaches (non-maleficence)
- **Bias patterns**: Systematically favouring one party type (justice)
- **Capacity assessment errors**: Improper application of MCA framework

### Expert Witness Engine (Ξ)

Evaluates compliance with expert duties:

- **FJC Guidelines**: Impartiality, evidence-based reasoning
- **FPR 25.14**: Statement of truth, materials reviewed, limitations
- **Opinion-evidence gap**: Conclusions unsupported by available evidence

### Accountability Engine (Λ)

Maps ethical breaches to professional standards:

- GMC paragraphs potentially breached
- Specific principles violated (autonomy, beneficence, etc.)
- Severity assessment (critical/high/medium/low)
- Referral recommendations with supporting evidence

### Contradiction Engine (Κ)

Identifies inconsistencies suggesting ethical issues:

- Expert's opinion contradicts their own prior reports
- Opinion contradicts available evidence
- Methodology differs from stated approach
- Certainty level inappropriate to evidence strength

### Documentary Analysis Engine (Δ)

For cases involving medical experts in media (e.g., Channel 4 documentary):

- Expert's broadcast statements vs court evidence
- Simplification vs misrepresentation boundary
- Confidentiality breaches
- Consent and autonomy violations

The platform enables systematic detection of patterns that would be invisible in single-case review, supporting accountability for medical professionals whose evidence impacts vulnerable individuals' lives.

## Conclusion

The four principles framework provides a systematic approach to medical ethics that has proven durable and adaptable across diverse contexts. While criticism focuses on its inability to resolve conflicts between principles, this flexibility allows contextual reasoning while maintaining core ethical commitments.

In UK practice, these principles are embedded in:

- **Law**: Mental Capacity Act 2005, common law on consent, human rights jurisprudence
- **Professional Regulation**: GMC standards, specialty-specific guidance
- **Institutional Practice**: NHS policies, clinical ethics committees, NICE guidance

For medical experts in legal proceedings, these principles take on additional significance. The expert's dual role—as medical professional bound by GMC standards and as court witness bound by duties to the court—creates unique ethical challenges. Respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice must inform every stage of expert work, from accepting instructions through assessment to report writing.

Where experts fail to adhere to these principles—offering opinions outside their competence, reaching unsupported conclusions, or acting as partisan advocates—they violate both professional standards and their duty to the court. Such failures can have devastating consequences for individuals whose lives depend on expert evidence, particularly in family proceedings involving children.

Systematic analysis of expert evidence through frameworks like the Phronesis Platform enables detection of ethical breaches that might otherwise remain hidden, supporting accountability and promoting adherence to the principles that should govern all medical practice.
