          <h1 id="decision-fatigue-and-cognitive-load">Decision Fatigue and Cognitive Load</h1>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Professional decision-makers---judges, social workers, police investigators, medical practitioners---are expected to exercise consistent, rational judgement throughout working days that may involve dozens of complex decisions. Yet cognitive science demonstrates that mental resources are finite. Working memory is sharply constrained. Self-regulation depletes. Quality degrades predictably as the day progresses.</p>
<p>This article examines the cognitive architecture underlying decision fatigue: the limited capacity of working memory, the three types of cognitive load, the ego depletion phenomenon, and the empirical evidence that high-stakes decisions (including judicial parole determinations) vary systematically based on timing rather than merit. We then explore implications for institutional design and how the Phronesis platform structurally compensates for these universal human limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Key insight</strong>: Decision quality is not a stable individual trait---it is a dynamic resource that depletes with use. Institutions that ignore this reality produce systematically biased outcomes, typically defaulting to risk-averse, status-quo-preserving decisions as mental resources exhaust.</p>

<h2 id="1-working-memory-the-bottleneck-of-thought">1. Working Memory: The Bottleneck of Thought</h2>
<h3 id="11-millers-magic-number">1.1 Miller's Magic Number</h3>
<p>In 1956, George Miller published one of psychology&#39;s most cited papers: &quot;The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two.&quot; Miller demonstrated that human working memory---the mental workspace where we hold and manipulate information---is sharply limited to approximately seven items (ranging from five to nine across individuals).</p>
<p>Working memory is not storage; it is processing. When analysing a complex case file, you cannot simultaneously hold in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>The timeline of events</li>
<li>The relationships between parties</li>
<li>The claims made by each witness</li>
<li>The documentary evidence</li>
<li>The legal standards to apply</li>
<li>The precedents that govern</li>
<li>The potential consequences of your decision</li>
</ul>
<p>Attempting to hold more than seven chunks of information causes displacement---earlier items are pushed out as new items enter. This is why, when reading a long document, you may reach the end having forgotten the beginning. It is why complex multi-factor decisions are so difficult without external aids.</p>
<h3 id="12-cowans-more-pessimistic-estimate">1.2 Cowan's More Pessimistic Estimate</h3>
<p>Subsequent research by Nelson Cowan (2001) suggested Miller&#39;s estimate was optimistic. Cowan argued that the true capacity of working memory without rehearsal is closer to four items---and possibly as few as three for complex information.</p>
<p>The implications are stark. A social worker conducting a risk assessment may need to weigh:</p>
<ol>
<li>Child&#39;s expressed wishes</li>
<li>Parent&#39;s historical behaviour</li>
<li>Current living conditions</li>
<li>Professional observations</li>
<li>School reports</li>
<li>Medical evidence</li>
<li>Sibling dynamics</li>
<li>Extended family context</li>
<li>Cultural factors</li>
<li>Resource availability</li>
</ol>
<p>This is ten factors---at least six beyond working memory capacity. Something must be dropped or chunked. What gets dropped is not random; it is systematic. Factors that are harder to process, less emotionally salient, or later in the review sequence are disproportionately neglected.</p>
<h3 id="13-the-chunking-solution-and-its-limits">1.3 The Chunking Solution and Its Limits</h3>
<p>Miller noted that experts expand effective working memory through chunking---combining individual items into meaningful groups. A chess grandmaster does not see 32 pieces in 64 squares; they see familiar patterns that compress information.</p>
<p>Professionals develop similar chunking through experience. An experienced judge does not process each element of a case de novo; they recognise case types, standard patterns, and typical trajectories. This expertise enables faster, more efficient processing.</p>
<p>But chunking introduces its own risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Template matching</strong> can cause novel cases to be forced into familiar categories</li>
<li><strong>Pattern completion</strong> may fill gaps with expected information rather than actual evidence</li>
<li><strong>Stereotyping</strong> (technically, the use of base-rate-informed priors) can disadvantage atypical cases</li>
</ul>
<p>Chunking is a compression algorithm. Like all compression, it loses information. The question is whether what is lost was important.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-cognitive-load-theory">2. Cognitive Load Theory</h2>
<h3 id="21-swellers-framework">2.1 Sweller's Framework</h3>
<p>John Sweller&#39;s Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), developed from the 1980s onwards, provides a framework for understanding how mental resources are consumed during complex tasks. Sweller identified three types of cognitive load:</p>
<p><strong>Intrinsic Load</strong>: The inherent complexity of the material itself. Some decisions are genuinely difficult because the subject matter is complex, the evidence is contradictory, or the stakes are high. A case involving multiple intersecting statutory frameworks, disputed facts, and uncertain outcomes has high intrinsic load regardless of how it is presented.</p>
<p><strong>Extraneous Load</strong>: Cognitive effort wasted due to poor presentation, unclear instructions, or inefficient processes. A poorly organised case bundle, inconsistent document formatting, missing page numbers, or unclear chronology all consume mental resources without advancing understanding. This load is parasitic---it consumes resources without contributing to decision quality.</p>
<p><strong>Germane Load</strong>: Mental effort devoted to building understanding, integrating information, and forming schemas. This is productive cognitive work: connecting evidence to conclusions, understanding relationships between parties, constructing coherent narratives from fragmentary data.</p>
<p>Total cognitive load = Intrinsic + Extraneous + Germane</p>
<p>When total load exceeds working memory capacity, performance degrades. The decision-maker may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Miss relevant information</li>
<li>Rely on heuristics and shortcuts</li>
<li>Make errors of logic or calculation</li>
<li>Default to simpler, more routine decisions</li>
<li>Experience subjective feelings of confusion or overwhelm</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="22-the-tragedy-of-extraneous-load">2.2 The Tragedy of Extraneous Load</h3>
<p>Institutional processes frequently impose massive extraneous load through:</p>
<p><strong>Poor document organisation</strong>: Case files assembled chronologically rather than thematically, forcing decision-makers to mentally reconstruct topics scattered across hundreds of pages.</p>
<p><strong>Inconsistent formatting</strong>: Different agencies using different templates, date formats, naming conventions, and terminology for identical concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Redundant information</strong>: The same facts repeated across multiple documents, requiring mental effort to recognise repetition rather than new information.</p>
<p><strong>Missing context</strong>: Documents assuming background knowledge the reader may not possess, requiring mental effort to infer what is being referenced.</p>
<p><strong>Jargon and acronyms</strong>: Technical language that must be decoded before content can be processed.</p>
<p>Every unit of mental resource consumed by extraneous load is unavailable for the substantive work of understanding the case and making good decisions. Institutions that tolerate high extraneous load systematically degrade decision quality.</p>
<h3 id="23-managing-cognitive-load">2.3 Managing Cognitive Load</h3>
<p>CLT suggests several strategies for reducing extraneous load:</p>
<p><strong>Pre-processing</strong>: Organise information before presenting it to decision-makers. Index documents by topic, not date. Create executive summaries. Highlight key passages.</p>
<p><strong>Standardisation</strong>: Use consistent formats, terminology, and templates across all documents. The mental effort saved in not having to decode formatting can be redirected to substance.</p>
<p><strong>Progressive disclosure</strong>: Present high-level summaries first, with detail available on demand. This allows decision-makers to allocate mental resources to areas of genuine uncertainty rather than exhaustively processing routine information.</p>
<p><strong>External memory aids</strong>: Provide tools that compensate for working memory limits---timelines, relationship diagrams, evidence matrices. These external representations hold information that would otherwise consume limited working memory.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-ego-depletion-and-the-limited-resource-model">3. Ego Depletion and the Limited Resource Model</h2>
<h3 id="31-baumeisters-muscle-model">3.1 Baumeister's Muscle Model</h3>
<p>Roy Baumeister and colleagues proposed that self-control operates like a muscle: it has finite strength that depletes with use and recovers with rest. In a series of experiments beginning in 1998, Baumeister demonstrated that exercising self-control on one task impaired performance on subsequent tasks requiring self-control.</p>
<p>In the classic radish study, participants who resisted eating chocolate cookies (high self-control demand) subsequently gave up faster on an unsolvable puzzle than participants who had been allowed to eat cookies (low self-control demand). The act of resisting temptation consumed a resource that was then unavailable for persistence.</p>
<p>This phenomenon was termed &quot;ego depletion&quot;---the temporary reduction in capacity for self-regulation following prior self-regulatory effort.</p>
<h3 id="32-what-depletes-the-resource">3.2 What Depletes the Resource?</h3>
<p>Research identified numerous activities that consume the limited self-control resource:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resisting temptation</li>
<li>Suppressing emotions</li>
<li>Making difficult choices</li>
<li>Controlling attention</li>
<li>Maintaining focus despite distractions</li>
<li>Overriding automatic responses</li>
<li>Managing impressions</li>
<li>Coping with stress</li>
</ul>
<p>Professional decision-making involves most of these simultaneously. A judge hearing a family case must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain impartiality (suppress emotional reactions)</li>
<li>Attend to lengthy submissions (control attention)</li>
<li>Override intuitive judgements that may be premature (override automatic responses)</li>
<li>Choose between competing interpretations (make difficult choices)</li>
<li>Manage courtroom proceedings (maintain professional demeanour)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these activities draws from the same limited resource pool.</p>
<h3 id="33-the-replication-crisis-and-refined-understanding">3.3 The Replication Crisis and Refined Understanding</h3>
<p>Ego depletion research became controversial following failed replications in the 2010s. A large-scale pre-registered replication (Hagger et al., 2016) found no significant ego depletion effect across 23 laboratories.</p>
<p>However, subsequent meta-analyses and theoretical refinements suggested the picture was more nuanced:</p>
<p><strong>Motivation matters</strong>: Depletion effects are stronger when subsequent tasks offer low motivation or reward. When highly motivated, people can draw on additional resources.</p>
<p><strong>Beliefs matter</strong>: Individuals who believe willpower is unlimited show smaller depletion effects. This suggests a role for subjective perception alongside objective resource constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Task specificity</strong>: Depletion may be more domain-specific than originally theorised, affecting similar self-control tasks more than dissimilar ones.</p>
<p><strong>Physiological factors</strong>: Blood glucose levels, sleep, stress hormones, and other physiological states interact with cognitive depletion.</p>
<p>The current consensus is not that ego depletion is false, but that it is more complex and context-dependent than originally proposed. For professional decision-making, the practical implications remain: sustained high-demand cognitive work degrades subsequent performance, and this effect is particularly pronounced under conditions of low motivation, fatigue, or stress.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-decision-fatigue-the-empirical-evidence">4. Decision Fatigue: The Empirical Evidence</h2>
<h3 id="41-the-parole-board-study">4.1 The Parole Board Study</h3>
<p>The most striking evidence for decision fatigue in high-stakes professional contexts comes from Danziger, Levav, and Avnaim-Pesso&#39;s 2011 study of Israeli parole boards.</p>
<p>The researchers analysed 1,112 judicial parole decisions over a ten-month period. They found that the probability of a favourable ruling (granting parole) was strongly predicted by the time since the judge&#39;s last break:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediately after breaks (morning start, post-snack, post-lunch): approximately 65% favourable rulings</li>
<li>Just before breaks: approximately 0% favourable rulings</li>
</ul>
<p>This was not a subtle effect. It was not explained by case characteristics, prisoner attributes, or attorney quality. The same judges making decisions on similar cases reached dramatically different conclusions depending on when in the session the case was heard.</p>
<p>The pattern suggests that as mental resources depleted, judges defaulted to the easier, safer, status-quo-preserving decision: deny parole. Granting parole requires active justification, assessment of risk, and responsibility for potential consequences. Denial requires only maintaining the current state.</p>
<h3 id="42-mechanism-default-to-easiest-option">4.2 Mechanism: Default to Easiest Option</h3>
<p>Decision fatigue does not cause random errors---it causes systematic bias toward cognitively easier options:</p>
<p><strong>Status quo bias</strong>: Maintaining current arrangements requires less justification than changing them.</p>
<p><strong>Denial over approval</strong>: Rejecting applications requires less analysis than approving them (you need not examine implementation details).</p>
<p><strong>Deferred decisions</strong>: Postponing decisions eliminates immediate cognitive burden (though it may increase total workload).</p>
<p><strong>Template decisions</strong>: Applying standard responses rather than tailoring to individual circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Risk aversion</strong>: Choosing options that minimise potential blame if outcomes are negative.</p>
<p>For the families and individuals affected by institutional decisions, this has profound implications. Your case outcome may depend less on its merits than on when it happens to be heard.</p>
<h3 id="43-judicial-decision-making-more-broadly">4.3 Judicial Decision-Making More Broadly</h3>
<p>The parole board study is not an isolated finding. Research across multiple judicial contexts has found similar effects:</p>
<p><strong>Asylum decisions</strong> (Chen et al., 2016): Immigration judges are more likely to deny asylum later in the day and on days following many grant decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Bail decisions</strong>: Studies show bail amounts and denial rates vary with hearing timing and sequence.</p>
<p><strong>Sentencing</strong>: Within-day and within-week patterns in sentence severity have been documented across jurisdictions.</p>
<p><strong>Medical decisions</strong>: Physician antibiotic prescription rates, screening recommendations, and treatment intensity vary with time of day and patient sequence.</p>
<p>The pattern is consistent: as the day progresses and decision load accumulates, decision-makers drift toward easier, more conservative, and often harsher default positions.</p>

<h2 id="5-attention-as-scarce-resource">5. Attention as Scarce Resource</h2>
<h3 id="51-the-economics-of-attention">5.1 The Economics of Attention</h3>
<p>Herbert Simon, the polymath who won the Nobel Prize in Economics, observed in 1971: &quot;A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.&quot; In institutional contexts, this insight has become ever more relevant as document volumes expand.</p>
<p>A family court case that might have involved dozens of pages in the 1970s now routinely involves thousands. Police investigation files can run to tens of thousands of pages. The information exists, but attention to process it does not scale proportionally.</p>
<p>When attention is scarce, it must be allocated. But attention allocation itself consumes attention---a recursive problem. Decision-makers must decide what to read carefully, what to skim, and what to skip. These allocation decisions are made under time pressure, with incomplete information about what each document contains.</p>
<h3 id="52-satisficing-under-attention-constraints">5.2 Satisficing Under Attention Constraints</h3>
<p>Simon coined the term &quot;satisficing&quot; to describe decision-making that seeks a satisfactory solution rather than an optimal one. Under attention constraints, satisficing becomes inevitable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read until you have enough information to reach a defensible decision</li>
<li>Stop when additional information seems unlikely to change the conclusion</li>
<li>Accept &quot;good enough&quot; when the cost of pursuing &quot;best&quot; exceeds available resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Satisficing is often rational given real-world constraints. But it introduces systematic biases:</p>
<p><strong>Early information overweighted</strong>: Documents read first receive more attention than documents read later.</p>
<p><strong>Confirming information overweighted</strong>: Once a tentative conclusion forms, information supporting it is sought; contradicting information is deprioritised.</p>
<p><strong>Salient information overweighted</strong>: Dramatic, recent, or emotionally-charged information captures attention at the expense of mundane but potentially more representative information.</p>
<h3 id="53-the-illusion-of-completeness">5.3 The Illusion of Completeness</h3>
<p>Perhaps most dangerously, attention constraints create an illusion of completeness. Having reviewed a case file, a decision-maker feels they have &quot;seen the evidence.&quot; But what they have actually done is sample the evidence according to attention allocation decisions they may not consciously remember making.</p>
<p>This illusion of completeness undermines error correction. If you do not know what you did not read, you cannot assess whether what you missed was important.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-implications-for-professional-decision-making">6. Implications for Professional Decision-Making</h2>
<h3 id="61-judges-and-tribunals">6.1 Judges and Tribunals</h3>
<p>The implications for judicial decision-making are profound and troubling:</p>
<p><strong>Scheduling effects</strong>: Litigants whose cases are heard after breaks receive systematically different treatment from those whose cases are heard before breaks.</p>
<p><strong>List management</strong>: Courts that schedule complex cases at the end of the day systematically disadvantage those parties.</p>
<p><strong>Reading time</strong>: Judges allocated insufficient reading time for case bundles will satisfice, potentially missing critical evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Sit duration</strong>: Long sitting periods without breaks accumulate decision fatigue, degrading decision quality over time.</p>
<h3 id="62-social-workers-and-investigators">6.2 Social Workers and Investigators</h3>
<p>For professionals making assessments and recommendations:</p>
<p><strong>Caseload effects</strong>: High caseloads mean each case receives depleted attention. Workers at the end of heavy days make systematically different decisions than at the start.</p>
<p><strong>Home visit timing</strong>: Assessments conducted late in the day, after multiple prior visits, draw on depleted resources.</p>
<p><strong>Writing fatigue</strong>: Reports drafted at the end of demanding days are more likely to rely on templates and less likely to capture case-specific nuance.</p>
<p><strong>Supervision quality</strong>: Supervisors reviewing large numbers of cases experience the same depletion effects, reducing the error-catching value of oversight.</p>
<h3 id="63-expert-witnesses">6.3 Expert Witnesses</h3>
<p>For professionals providing expert opinions:</p>
<p><strong>Sequential case effects</strong>: Experts who assess multiple cases in sequence may apply progressively more template-driven analysis to later cases.</p>
<p><strong>Report writing</strong>: Complex reports drafted under time pressure and cognitive depletion are more likely to contain errors or omissions.</p>
<p><strong>Testimony stamina</strong>: Experts giving evidence after hours of cross-examination are more susceptible to errors and inconsistencies.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="7-strategies-for-managing-cognitive-load">7. Strategies for Managing Cognitive Load</h2>
<h3 id="71-individual-strategies">7.1 Individual Strategies</h3>
<p><strong>Strategic scheduling</strong>: Make important decisions when cognitively fresh. Reserve complex analysis for morning hours or immediately after breaks.</p>
<p><strong>Protective breaks</strong>: Regular breaks restore cognitive resources. Brief breaks every 90 minutes are more effective than long breaks after exhaustion.</p>
<p><strong>External memory</strong>: Use written notes, diagrams, and checklists to offload information from working memory. Reconstruct context rather than remembering it.</p>
<p><strong>Task batching</strong>: Group similar tasks together to reduce switching costs. Process all emails, then all case reviews, rather than interleaving.</p>
<p><strong>Decision limits</strong>: Set maximum numbers of high-stakes decisions per session. Defer rather than decide when depleted.</p>
<h3 id="72-institutional-strategies">7.2 Institutional Strategies</h3>
<p><strong>Workload management</strong>: Recognise that decision capacity is finite. Smaller caseloads produce better decisions, not just less stress.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule design</strong>: Structure schedules with breaks before predictable depletion points. Front-load complex decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Document standards</strong>: Mandate consistent formatting, clear executive summaries, and logical organisation to reduce extraneous load.</p>
<p><strong>Decision support tools</strong>: Provide checklists, templates, and aids that compensate for working memory limits.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome tracking</strong>: Monitor whether decision patterns vary with timing, sequence, or workload. If they do, this indicates resource constraint effects.</p>
<h3 id="73-process-design-principles">7.3 Process Design Principles</h3>
<p><strong>Reduce extraneous load first</strong>: Before demanding more of decision-makers, eliminate waste in how information is presented.</p>
<p><strong>Separate analysis from decision</strong>: Have different individuals or different sessions for gathering information versus reaching conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>Build in redundancy</strong>: Multiple reviewers catch errors that depleted individuals miss.</p>
<p><strong>Protect deliberation time</strong>: Decisions made under time pressure are more susceptible to fatigue effects.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="8-institutional-design-considerations">8. Institutional Design Considerations</h2>
<h3 id="81-the-accountability-gap">8.1 The Accountability Gap</h3>
<p>Institutional accountability systems rarely account for cognitive load effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulators assess whether a decision was wrong, not whether decision conditions made errors likely</li>
<li>Appeals examine reasoning, not resource constraints that shaped reasoning</li>
<li>Performance management tracks throughput without accounting for decision quality variation</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates perverse incentives: processing more cases faster is rewarded, even when this demonstrably degrades decision quality.</p>
<h3 id="82-design-principles-for-cognitively-aware-institutions">8.2 Design Principles for Cognitively-Aware Institutions</h3>
<p><strong>Acknowledge human limits</strong>: Design systems for actual human cognitive architecture, not idealised rational agents.</p>
<p><strong>Measure what matters</strong>: Track decision quality, not just decision volume. Monitor for timing effects and sequential dependencies.</p>
<p><strong>Distribute load</strong>: Spread complex decisions across time and decision-makers rather than concentrating them.</p>
<p><strong>Build in recovery</strong>: Mandate breaks, limit sitting times, protect rest periods.</p>
<p><strong>Audit for depletion effects</strong>: Regularly analyse whether decision patterns show signatures of cognitive depletion.</p>
<h3 id="83-the-cost-of-ignoring-cognitive-limits">8.3 The Cost of Ignoring Cognitive Limits</h3>
<p>When institutions ignore cognitive load constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decision quality degrades in predictable, systematic ways</li>
<li>Outcomes depend on scheduling rather than merits</li>
<li>Individual professionals are blamed for system-induced errors</li>
<li>Appeals and complaints rise as decision quality falls</li>
<li>Public confidence in institutional competence erodes</li>
</ul>
<p>The aggregate cost of cognitively-naive institutional design is incalculable but certainly massive.</p>

<h2 id="9-connection-to-phronesis-platform">9. Connection to Phronesis Platform</h2>
<p>The Phronesis platform addresses cognitive load through multiple structural mechanisms:</p>
<h3 id="91-reducing-extraneous-load">9.1 Reducing Extraneous Load</h3>
<p><strong>Automated document processing</strong>: Standardises formatting, extracts metadata, and organises materials thematically rather than chronologically.</p>
<p><strong>Entity resolution</strong>: Automatically identifies and links references to the same individuals, organisations, and events across documents, eliminating the cognitive load of manual cross-referencing.</p>
<p><strong>Executive summaries</strong>: Generates high-level overviews that allow analysts to allocate attention strategically.</p>
<p><strong>Visual representations</strong>: Timelines, relationship graphs, and evidence matrices externalise information that would otherwise consume working memory.</p>
<h3 id="92-compensating-for-working-memory-limits">9.2 Compensating for Working Memory Limits</h3>
<p><strong>Persistent state</strong>: The platform maintains context across sessions, eliminating the need to mentally reconstruct where you were.</p>
<p><strong>Contradiction detection</strong>: Automated flagging of inconsistencies means analysts need not hold all claims in mind simultaneously to detect conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-referencing</strong>: Hyperlinked claims and evidence allow immediate access to relevant context without sequential search.</p>
<p><strong>Structured checklists</strong>: S.A.M. phase requirements ensure comprehensive coverage without relying on memory for what has and has not been examined.</p>
<h3 id="93-protecting-against-depletion-effects">9.3 Protecting Against Depletion Effects</h3>
<p><strong>Session management</strong>: The platform tracks analysis progress, enabling clean handoffs between sessions without loss of context.</p>
<p><strong>Quantified progress</strong>: Clear indicators of what remains to be analysed prevent the &quot;feel&quot; of completeness from substituting for actual completeness.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency enforcement</strong>: Structured output requirements reduce the drift toward template responses that characterises depleted analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Audit trails</strong>: Comprehensive logging enables retrospective identification of potential depletion-influenced analysis.</p>
<h3 id="94-supporting-germane-load">9.4 Supporting Germane Load</h3>
<p>By reducing extraneous load and compensating for working memory limits, Phronesis frees cognitive resources for productive analysis---the germane load of understanding, integrating, and concluding. Analysts can direct their finite mental resources toward substantive work rather than administrative overhead.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="10-conclusion-designing-for-human-minds">10. Conclusion: Designing for Human Minds</h2>
<p>Decision fatigue and cognitive load are not excuses for poor performance---they are fundamental constraints that must be designed around. Institutions that ignore these constraints do not produce more decisions; they produce worse decisions, with consequences borne by the individuals and families subject to those decisions.</p>
<p>The evidence is clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working memory is sharply limited (4-7 items)</li>
<li>Extraneous cognitive load wastes limited resources</li>
<li>Self-regulation depletes with use</li>
<li>Decision quality degrades predictably with time and load</li>
<li>Depleted decision-makers default to easier, often harsher, status-quo-preserving choices</li>
</ul>
<p>Effective institutional design acknowledges these realities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce unnecessary cognitive load through better information presentation</li>
<li>Structure schedules around predictable depletion patterns</li>
<li>Provide tools that compensate for working memory limits</li>
<li>Track decision quality, not just decision volume</li>
<li>Hold systems accountable for creating conditions that degrade decisions</li>
</ul>
<p>The Phronesis platform embeds these principles technically: automated load reduction, external memory aids, structured analysis phases, and persistent context. But technology alone is insufficient. Institutional culture must acknowledge human cognitive limits and design processes accordingly.</p>
<p>A system that schedules its most important decisions for depleted decision-makers at the end of long days is not merely inefficient---it is unjust. Justice requires not only fair rules but fair conditions for applying them.</p>
<p><strong>Core principle</strong>: &quot;Decision quality is a resource that depletes. Institutions must design for human minds, not idealised calculators.&quot;</p>
