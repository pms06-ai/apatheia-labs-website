<p><strong>Document Classification:</strong> Theoretical Framework
<strong>Version:</strong> 1.0
<strong>Date:</strong> 2026-01-18
<strong>Purpose:</strong> Provide analytical frameworks for understanding how power operates within and across institutions</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Power is the central concern of forensic institutional analysis. When we trace how false premises propagate through agencies, how accountability gaps form, or why institutions systematically fail to self-correct, we are fundamentally analysing power: who has it, how they exercise it, and what mechanisms sustain it against challenge.</p>
<p>This article synthesises classical and contemporary theories of power to provide analytical tools for the Systematic Adversarial Methodology. From Weber&#39;s foundational typology of authority to Foucault&#39;s analysis of disciplinary power, from Bourdieu&#39;s capitals to Lipsky&#39;s street-level bureaucrats, each framework illuminates different aspects of how institutions exercise control while evading accountability.</p>
<p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> Power in modern institutions operates through multiple, mutually reinforcing mechanisms. Formal authority provides legitimacy; disciplinary practices produce compliance; professional boundaries exclude challenge; and cultural capital determines whose knowledge counts. Understanding this multiplicity is essential for effective forensic analysis.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-introduction-why-power-analysis-matters">1. Introduction: Why Power Analysis Matters</h2>
<p>Every institutional failure involves power. When a child protection system fails to protect, power dynamics determined which voices were heard and which were dismissed. When police investigations develop tunnel vision, power structured whose account became the official narrative. When healthcare systems deny treatment, power decided what counted as evidence and who had authority to interpret it.</p>
<p>Yet power is precisely what institutions prefer not to discuss. Organisational charts show formal hierarchies; mission statements proclaim service to clients; policies emphasise procedural fairness. The actual operations of power remain invisible, naturalised, taken for granted.</p>
<p>Forensic analysis requires making power visible. This means understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How authority is claimed and legitimated</strong></li>
<li><strong>How power operates through knowledge and expertise</strong></li>
<li><strong>How resources (capitals) translate into institutional advantage</strong></li>
<li><strong>How professional boundaries exclude outside challenge</strong></li>
<li><strong>How bureaucratic discretion creates accountability gaps</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This article provides the theoretical foundations for such analysis.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-webers-three-types-of-authority">2. Weber's Three Types of Authority</h2>
<h3 id="the-foundation-of-legitimacy-theory">The Foundation of Legitimacy Theory</h3>
<p>Max Weber (1922) distinguished power from authority. <strong>Power</strong> is the ability to impose one&#39;s will despite resistance. <strong>Authority</strong> is power that is accepted as legitimate by those subject to it. This distinction is fundamental: institutions prefer to exercise authority rather than naked power because authority requires less effort and generates less resistance.</p>
<p>Weber identified three pure types of authority, each with distinct bases of legitimacy:</p>
<h3 id="traditional-authority">Traditional Authority</h3>
<p>Traditional authority rests on <strong>established custom and inherited status</strong>. It is legitimate because it has always been so. The authority of monarchs, clan elders, and established churches derives from tradition.</p>
<p><strong>Institutional relevance:</strong> While apparently archaic, traditional authority persists within modern institutions. Senior professionals command deference partly through formal position but partly through accumulated tenure. &quot;The way we&#39;ve always done it&quot; carries weight independent of evidence. Organisational traditions—the annual conference, the established committee structure, the customary practices—acquire authority simply through persistence.</p>
<p><strong>UK example:</strong> The deference historically accorded to the medical profession, particularly consultant physicians, contains strong elements of traditional authority. The white coat, the Latinate terminology, the hierarchical ward round—these are traditional markers that command compliance beyond what rational assessment of competence would justify.</p>
<h3 id="charismatic-authority">Charismatic Authority</h3>
<p>Charismatic authority rests on <strong>exceptional personal qualities</strong>. Followers believe the leader possesses extraordinary gifts—vision, heroism, or sanctity—that entitle them to command obedience.</p>
<p><strong>Institutional relevance:</strong> Charismatic authority appears unstable but is repeatedly relevant. Transformational leaders who rescue failing organisations exercise charismatic authority. Whistle-blowers who challenge institutional orthodoxies may acquire charismatic status. Expert witnesses whose testimony carries exceptional weight may do so partly through charisma rather than pure expertise.</p>
<p>The danger of charismatic authority is its personalisation. When a charismatic chief constable leaves, reforms may evaporate. When a charismatic clinician retires, their service may decline. Charisma is difficult to institutionalise.</p>
<h3 id="rational-legal-authority">Rational-Legal Authority</h3>
<p>Rational-legal authority rests on <strong>established rules and procedures</strong>. It is legitimate because it operates through transparent, consistent, and formally enacted regulations. The authority of bureaucrats, judges, and elected officials derives from their position within legally constituted structures.</p>
<p><strong>Institutional relevance:</strong> Modern institutions claim rational-legal authority almost exclusively. The police officer exercises authority not as an individual but as the holder of a legally defined role. The social worker&#39;s authority to investigate families derives from statutory provisions. The regulator&#39;s power to sanction derives from legislation.</p>
<p>This claim to rational-legal legitimacy is simultaneously institutions&#39; greatest strength and their greatest vulnerability. It is a strength because it provides stable, predictable authority that does not depend on individual qualities. It is a vulnerability because failures of procedure—the investigation that cut corners, the regulator that exceeded its mandate, the decision-maker who was biased—delegitimate the authority claimed.</p>
<h3 id="the-power-authority-distinction-in-practice">The Power-Authority Distinction in Practice</h3>
<p>Weber&#39;s distinction illuminates forensic analysis in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Authority claims can be challenged on their own terms.</strong> If an institution claims rational-legal authority, demonstrating procedural failures attacks the basis of that claim.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Power without authority is visible.</strong> When institutions resort to coercion, threats, or manipulation, they reveal that their authority claims are insufficient.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Authority can be manufactured.</strong> Institutions work to construct legitimacy even for actions that lack proper authorisation. Understanding this construction process is central to forensic analysis.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="3-power-and-knowledge-foucaults-framework">3. Power and Knowledge: Foucault's Framework</h2>
<h3 id="beyond-sovereign-power">Beyond Sovereign Power</h3>
<p>Michel Foucault (1977, 1980) transformed power analysis by arguing that modern power operates primarily not through sovereign command but through <strong>disciplinary mechanisms</strong> embedded in everyday practices. Power is not primarily repressive but productive: it does not simply forbid but shapes what is possible, thinkable, and normal.</p>
<h3 id="disciplinary-power">Disciplinary Power</h3>
<p>Disciplinary power operates through:</p>
<p><strong>Surveillance:</strong> The awareness of being observed produces self-regulation. Foucault&#39;s famous analysis of Bentham&#39;s Panopticon—a prison design where inmates could always be watched but never knew when—illustrated how visibility itself becomes a mechanism of control.</p>
<p><strong>Normalisation:</strong> Disciplinary institutions establish norms against which individuals are measured, ranked, and corrected. The deviation from normal becomes visible and subject to intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Examination:</strong> The combination of surveillance and normalisation in formal assessment. Examinations—medical, educational, professional—simultaneously observe, measure against norms, and produce authoritative knowledge about the individual.</p>
<p><strong>UK institutional examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Child protection:</strong> The Common Assessment Framework operates as a disciplinary mechanism. It establishes norms (developmental milestones, parenting standards), creates visibility (documented assessments), and subjects families to examination (multi-agency review). Parents become objects of professional gaze.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Police custody:</strong> The custody suite exemplifies disciplinary space. CCTV surveillance, standardised risk assessments, formal booking procedures—each element operates as a disciplinary mechanism, producing compliant detainees while generating documentary evidence.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Clinical pathways establish normative treatment sequences. Deviation from pathway requires justification. The pathway disciplines clinical practice while appearing merely to describe best practice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="power-knowledge">Power-Knowledge</h3>
<p>Foucault&#39;s most influential contribution was recognising that <strong>power and knowledge are inseparable</strong>. Knowledge is not neutral description but is produced through power relations and in turn supports particular power arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>Forensic implications:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Expertise is power.</strong> The expert who defines what counts as evidence, what interpretive frameworks are legitimate, and what conclusions are warranted exercises power through knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Categories are political.</strong> Diagnostic categories, risk classifications, and legal definitions are not neutral descriptions but power-laden constructs that determine who is subject to intervention.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Truth is produced, not discovered.</strong> Institutional processes produce &quot;truth&quot; through procedures that advantage some accounts over others. The investigation that produces an official finding, the inquiry that establishes what happened, the court that determines guilt—each produces truth through power-laden processes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="discourse-and-exclusion">Discourse and Exclusion</h3>
<p>Foucault (1981) analysed how <strong>discourse</strong>—the rules governing what can be said, by whom, in what circumstances—operates as a power mechanism. Discursive rules exclude certain speakers, topics, and claims from legitimate consideration.</p>
<p><strong>UK examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Family courts:</strong> The discourse of &quot;welfare of the child&quot; excludes consideration of parental rights as rights. Parents who frame claims in rights language are discursively positioned as failing to prioritise their children.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mental health:</strong> The discourse of clinical expertise excludes patient knowledge about their own experience. The service user who challenges their diagnosis is repositioned as lacking insight—a symptom of their condition.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Broadcasting regulation:</strong> The discourse of editorial independence excludes consideration of power imbalances. The complainant who alleges unfairness is positioned as seeking to infringe legitimate journalistic freedom.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-bourdieu-capital-and-field-theory">4. Bourdieu: Capital and Field Theory</h2>
<h3 id="beyond-economic-capital">Beyond Economic Capital</h3>
<p>Pierre Bourdieu (1984, 1986) extended the concept of capital beyond economics to understand how advantages are accumulated, converted, and transmitted. He identified multiple forms of capital:</p>
<h3 id="economic-capital">Economic Capital</h3>
<p>Material wealth and financial resources. Economic capital is immediately convertible into goods and services and can be institutionalised as property rights.</p>
<h3 id="cultural-capital">Cultural Capital</h3>
<p>Knowledge, skills, and educational credentials valued within particular fields. Cultural capital exists in three forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embodied:</strong> Internalised dispositions and competences (how to speak, dress, behave in professional settings)</li>
<li><strong>Objectified:</strong> Cultural goods (books, artworks, technologies)</li>
<li><strong>Institutionalised:</strong> Credentials and qualifications that formally certify cultural competence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Institutional relevance:</strong> Professional credentials are institutionalised cultural capital. The letters after a name (FRCP, QC, FCIPD) signal competence recognised by authoritative institutions. These credentials create barriers to challenge: the unqualified complainant lacks the cultural capital to contest the qualified professional.</p>
<h3 id="social-capital">Social Capital</h3>
<p>Networks of relationships that can be mobilised for advantage. Social capital includes formal memberships (professional associations, clubs) and informal connections (who you know, who will vouch for you).</p>
<p><strong>Institutional relevance:</strong> Social capital explains why some complaints are heard and others ignored. The complainant who knows someone inside the institution, who can invoke a connection to authority, whose network includes journalists or politicians, will be treated differently from the isolated individual.</p>
<h3 id="symbolic-capital">Symbolic Capital</h3>
<p>Recognition, prestige, and honour. Symbolic capital is the acknowledgment by others that one possesses valued capitals. It legitimates the holder&#39;s position and claims.</p>
<p><strong>Institutional relevance:</strong> Institutions accumulate symbolic capital through reputation, history, and public recognition. The NHS, the BBC, the police—each possesses institutional symbolic capital that insulates it from challenge. Attacking an institution with high symbolic capital is inherently more difficult because the attacker lacks comparable legitimacy.</p>
<h3 id="field-theory">Field Theory</h3>
<p>Bourdieu analysed society as composed of relatively autonomous <strong>fields</strong>—social arenas with their own rules, stakes, and valued capitals. The legal field, the medical field, the journalistic field—each has distinctive logics of practice.</p>
<p><strong>Forensic implications:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Fields have gatekeepers.</strong> Entry to the field requires appropriate capitals. The complainant from outside the field lacks the capitals to participate effectively.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Field-specific capital is not portable.</strong> Medical expertise carries weight in the medical field but may carry less in the legal field. Institutions can exploit mismatches between fields.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Field boundaries are defended.</strong> Professionals protect their jurisdiction by excluding outsiders. Boundary maintenance is a form of power.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-institutional-isomorphism-and-power">5. Institutional Isomorphism and Power</h2>
<h3 id="conformity-as-power">Conformity as Power</h3>
<p>DiMaggio and Powell&#39;s (1983) analysis of institutional isomorphism (discussed in <a href="/research/sociology/01-institutional-behavior/">Institutional Behavior</a>) has direct implications for power analysis. Isomorphism is not neutral convergence but involves power relations:</p>
<h3 id="coercive-isomorphism-as-power">Coercive Isomorphism as Power</h3>
<p>When government mandates particular practices, it exercises power over organisations. Regulatory requirements create compliance regardless of local assessment. The power to define what organisations must do is concentrated at the centre while implementation burdens are distributed.</p>
<p><strong>UK example:</strong> Ofsted&#39;s power to determine inspection frameworks shapes educational practice across thousands of schools. Local professional judgment is subordinated to centrally defined standards. The power exercised is enormous yet diffuse—experienced as &quot;best practice&quot; rather than imposition.</p>
<h3 id="mimetic-isomorphism-and-reputation-power">Mimetic Isomorphism and Reputation Power</h3>
<p>Organisations imitate those perceived as successful. But who determines which organisations are successful? Power lies with those who can define success, publicise exemplars, and establish reputational hierarchies.</p>
<p><strong>UK example:</strong> The NHS &quot;learning from excellence&quot; agenda positions certain Trusts as models. But model status is constructed through reporting, awards, and official recognition. Power lies with those who control these legitimation mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="normative-isomorphism-and-professional-power">Normative Isomorphism and Professional Power</h3>
<p>Professional training creates shared norms. But professions are not neutral; they defend jurisdictions, exclude competitors, and define what counts as competent practice. Normative isomorphism transmits professional power through education and credentialing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-street-level-bureaucracy-discretion-and-power">6. Street-Level Bureaucracy: Discretion and Power</h2>
<h3 id="lipskys-framework">Lipsky's Framework</h3>
<p>Michael Lipsky (1980) identified <strong>street-level bureaucrats</strong>—public service workers who interact directly with citizens and exercise substantial discretion in applying policy. Teachers, police officers, social workers, healthcare staff—these frontline workers are where policy meets practice.</p>
<h3 id="the-reality-of-discretion">The Reality of Discretion</h3>
<p>Street-level bureaucrats face impossible demands:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inadequate resources</strong> for the tasks assigned</li>
<li><strong>Ambiguous or contradictory policy</strong> requiring interpretation</li>
<li><strong>Unpredictable situations</strong> that rules cannot fully anticipate</li>
<li><strong>Clients who do not fit categories</strong> designed for aggregate populations</li>
</ul>
<p>To cope, they develop <strong>routines, shortcuts, and rationing mechanisms</strong> that allow work to proceed. These coping mechanisms constitute real policy regardless of official pronouncements.</p>
<h3 id="discretion-as-power">Discretion as Power</h3>
<p>Discretionary judgment is power exercised at the point of delivery:</p>
<ul>
<li>The police officer who decides whether behaviour constitutes disorder</li>
<li>The social worker who decides whether parenting is &quot;good enough&quot;</li>
<li>The benefits officer who decides whether circumstances warrant exception</li>
<li>The teacher who decides whether a child needs safeguarding referral</li>
</ul>
<p>These decisions are individually small but collectively massive. They determine who receives services, who is investigated, who is sanctioned.</p>
<p><strong>UK examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Police stop and search:</strong> Officers exercise discretion in deciding who warrants stopping. Statistical patterns reveal systematic racial disproportionality, suggesting discretion is exercised in racially patterned ways.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Child protection:</strong> Social workers exercise discretion in deciding which referrals warrant investigation. Research shows discretion is shaped by workload, prior experience, and cultural assumptions about families.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Benefits sanctions:</strong> Work coaches exercise discretion in applying sanction policies. Claimants with identical circumstances may receive different treatment depending on individual officer judgment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="accountability-gaps">Accountability Gaps</h3>
<p>Street-level discretion creates systematic accountability gaps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Invisibility:</strong> Individual decisions are rarely scrutinised</li>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Records reflect official categories, not actual reasoning</li>
<li><strong>Aggregation:</strong> Patterns emerge from individual decisions but no one is accountable for the pattern</li>
<li><strong>Insulation:</strong> Workers are insulated by professional autonomy and workload pressures</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="7-professional-jurisdictions-and-boundary-maintenance">7. Professional Jurisdictions and Boundary Maintenance</h2>
<h3 id="abbotts-system-of-professions">Abbott's System of Professions</h3>
<p>Andrew Abbott (1988) analysed how professions claim and defend <strong>jurisdictions</strong>—exclusive rights to perform particular work. Jurisdictional claims involve:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> The right to define what the problem is</li>
<li><strong>Inference:</strong> The right to reason about causes and solutions</li>
<li><strong>Treatment:</strong> The right to address the problem</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="boundary-maintenance-as-power">Boundary Maintenance as Power</h3>
<p>Professions defend boundaries against competitors through:</p>
<p><strong>Credentialing:</strong> Formal qualifications that exclude the unqualified. Medical registration, legal certification, professional accreditation—each creates barriers to entry.</p>
<p><strong>Language:</strong> Technical terminology that excludes outsiders. Medical Latin, legal jargon, social work acronyms—specialised language marks insiders and excludes laypeople.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory capture:</strong> Professions influence their own regulation, ensuring regulators share professional assumptions and defend professional interests.</p>
<p><strong>Epistemological claims:</strong> Professions claim distinctive knowledge that laypeople cannot possess. The claim to esoteric knowledge justifies excluding outside judgment.</p>
<h3 id="implications-for-accountability">Implications for Accountability</h3>
<p>Professional boundary maintenance creates accountability challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Only peers can judge.</strong> If professional work can only be assessed by those with professional knowledge, accountability is internal to the profession.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Complaints require translation.</strong> Lay complainants must frame concerns in professional language. This translation is itself a site of power—professionals control whether translations are adequate.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Regulators are captured.</strong> Professional regulators often share professional culture and protect professional interests. The HCPC regulates social workers; but it is staffed by professionals who share social work assumptions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="8-hierarchies-and-accountability-gaps">8. Hierarchies and Accountability Gaps</h2>
<h3 id="how-hierarchy-creates-gaps">How Hierarchy Creates Gaps</h3>
<p>Institutional hierarchies create systematic accountability gaps:</p>
<h3 id="upward-distortion">Upward Distortion</h3>
<p>Information flowing upward through hierarchies is systematically filtered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subordinates protect superiors</strong> from unwelcome information</li>
<li><strong>Middle management smooths</strong> reports to avoid blame</li>
<li><strong>Aggregation</strong> loses individual detail</li>
<li><strong>Delay</strong> allows problems to be addressed before they reach leadership</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaders may be genuinely ignorant of problems occurring below.</p>
<h3 id="downward-dilution">Downward Dilution</h3>
<p>Decisions flowing downward are systematically transformed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ambiguity</strong> is introduced to allow local interpretation</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> are inadequate for full implementation</li>
<li><strong>Competing priorities</strong> require trade-offs</li>
<li><strong>Street-level discretion</strong> modifies application</li>
</ul>
<p>Policy intent may be genuinely different from policy implementation.</p>
<h3 id="lateral-gaps">Lateral Gaps</h3>
<p>Horizontal divisions between departments, agencies, and professions create:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information silos</strong> where relevant knowledge does not flow</li>
<li><strong>Blame displacement</strong> where responsibility is shifted laterally</li>
<li><strong>Coordination failures</strong> where no one owns the whole problem</li>
<li><strong>Competitive dynamics</strong> where collaboration is undermined</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-accountability-paradox">The Accountability Paradox</h3>
<p>The result is what might be termed the <strong>accountability paradox</strong>: institutional structures designed to ensure control simultaneously create gaps where control fails and no one is accountable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Senior leaders are not accountable because they did not know</li>
<li>Middle managers are not accountable because they were following policy</li>
<li>Frontline workers are not accountable because they were following instructions</li>
<li>The institution is not accountable because it has demonstrated processes</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone did their job. The outcome was nevertheless harmful. Accountability dissolves into structure.</p>

<h2 id="9-connection-to-phronesis-platform">9. Connection to Phronesis Platform</h2>
<p>The theoretical frameworks in this article directly inform Phronesis&#39;s analytical engines:</p>
<h3 id="accountability-audit-engine-lambda">Accountability Audit Engine (Lambda)</h3>
<p>The Lambda engine operationalises power analysis by mapping:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Statutory duties</strong> to specific role-holders</li>
<li><strong>Decision points</strong> where authority was exercised</li>
<li><strong>Information flows</strong> that should have triggered action</li>
<li><strong>Gaps</strong> between formal authority and actual accountability</li>
</ul>
<p>Lambda treats accountability as a structural property, not an individual attribute. It asks: where in the hierarchy did responsibility lie, and how did structure create gaps?</p>
<h3 id="professional-tracker-engine-pi">Professional Tracker Engine (Pi)</h3>
<p>The Pi engine applies Abbott&#39;s jurisdiction theory by tracking:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Professional role boundaries</strong> and their maintenance</li>
<li><strong>Inter-professional handoffs</strong> where jurisdiction transfers</li>
<li><strong>Boundary disputes</strong> where professionals contest responsibility</li>
<li><strong>Credential deployment</strong> where qualifications are invoked to exclude challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>Pi identifies how professional power was exercised and where professional boundaries created blind spots.</p>
<h3 id="bias-detection-engine-beta">Bias Detection Engine (Beta)</h3>
<p>The Beta engine operationalises Bourdieu&#39;s capital analysis by measuring:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voice distribution:</strong> Whose account receives attention?</li>
<li><strong>Framing ratios:</strong> How are different parties characterised?</li>
<li><strong>Capital effects:</strong> Do credentials, connections, or status affect treatment?</li>
<li><strong>Omission patterns:</strong> Whose perspective is systematically excluded?</li>
</ul>
<p>Beta quantifies the power dynamics that qualitative analysis identifies, providing statistical evidence for patterns of advantage and disadvantage.</p>
<h3 id="sam-integration">S.A.M. Integration</h3>
<p>The Systematic Adversarial Methodology (S.A.M.) integrates these power-analytical tools across its four phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ANCHOR:</strong> Identifies whose power defined the original framing</li>
<li><strong>INHERIT:</strong> Traces how power relations enabled propagation without verification</li>
<li><strong>COMPOUND:</strong> Documents how institutional authority accumulated around claims</li>
<li><strong>ARRIVE:</strong> Maps how power dynamics produced harmful outcomes</li>
</ul>
<p>Power analysis is not separate from S.A.M. but constitutive of it. Every false premise, every propagation pathway, every accountability gap is a power relation made visible.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="10-conclusion-making-power-visible">10. Conclusion: Making Power Visible</h2>
<p>Institutions prefer power to remain invisible. When power operates through taken-for-granted structures, normalised practices, and unquestioned expertise, it encounters minimal resistance. The task of forensic analysis is to make power visible.</p>
<p>This requires:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Authority analysis:</strong> Identifying what type of authority is claimed and whether claims are warranted</li>
<li><strong>Disciplinary mapping:</strong> Tracing how institutional practices produce compliance and construct truth</li>
<li><strong>Capital identification:</strong> Recognising how resources (credentials, networks, reputation) create advantage</li>
<li><strong>Discretion tracking:</strong> Following how frontline decisions aggregate into patterns</li>
<li><strong>Boundary analysis:</strong> Understanding how professional jurisdictions exclude challenge</li>
<li><strong>Gap identification:</strong> Locating where hierarchical structures dissolve accountability</li>
</ol>
<p>Power made visible can be challenged. Power that remains invisible operates unchecked.</p>
<p>The frameworks presented here—Weber, Foucault, Bourdieu, Lipsky, Abbott—are not merely academic. They are analytical tools for understanding how institutions actually operate, why they fail, and why they resist acknowledging failure. For forensic analysis of institutional behaviour, power analysis is not optional but essential.</p>
