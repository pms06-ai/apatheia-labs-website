# Attention and Perception - The Neuroscience of What We Notice

**Document Classification:** Foundational Research
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-01-18
**Purpose:** Establish neuroscientific framework for understanding attentional limitations and their implications for observational evidence in institutional document analysis

---

## Executive Summary

What we perceive is not reality; it is a construction shaped by attention. This fundamental insight from cognitive neuroscience has profound implications for evaluating observational evidence, professional judgements, and witness accounts. Decades of research, exemplified by Simons and Chabris's invisible gorilla study, demonstrate that humans routinely fail to notice highly salient events occurring directly in their field of view.

For forensic document analysis, these findings establish critical principles: observers cannot reliably report what they did not attend to, expectations powerfully shape what is noticed, and failures to observe do not indicate absence. Understanding attentional limitations enables analysts to identify when observational evidence is unreliable and when institutional systems have been designed without accounting for human attentional capacity.

**Core Principle:** Attention is a limited resource that creates systematic gaps in perception. Observational failures are not necessarily failures of diligence but often reflect the fundamental architecture of human cognition.

## 1. Selective Attention and the Cocktail Party Effect

Selective attention is the cognitive process by which we focus on relevant information while filtering out irrelevant stimuli. Cherry's (1953) cocktail party effect established the foundational phenomenon: at a noisy party, you can focus on one conversation while filtering out surrounding chatter - yet you will immediately notice if your name is spoken nearby.

### Key Characteristics

- Attended information receives detailed processing
- Unattended information is processed shallowly or not at all
- Certain stimuli (own name, threat cues) can capture attention despite filtering
- Selection occurs early in processing, not just at response

Broadbent (1958) proposed that attention operates as an early filter, selecting inputs based on physical characteristics before semantic processing. Later research (Treisman, 1964) demonstrated that some semantic processing occurs pre-attentively, leading to attenuated filter models where unattended information is weakened rather than eliminated.

### Forensic Implications

When a witness reports not hearing a conversation or not noticing an individual, this does not indicate the conversation or individual was absent. It indicates the witness's attention was directed elsewhere. A clinician focused on one patient may genuinely fail to register another's deterioration despite being physically present.

## 2. Inattentional Blindness: The Invisible Gorilla Paradigm

Inattentional blindness is the failure to notice a fully visible but unexpected object or event when attention is engaged elsewhere. This phenomenon demonstrates that attention is necessary for conscious perception - visibility is not sufficient.

### The Classic Demonstration

Simons and Chabris (1999) conducted the paradigmatic demonstration:

- Participants watched a video of two teams passing basketballs
- Task: Count passes made by one team (white shirts)
- During the video, a person in a gorilla suit walked through the scene, faced the camera, thumped their chest, and exited (9 seconds on screen)
- Approximately 50% of participants failed to notice the gorilla
- Those who missed it expressed disbelief when shown the video again

Drew, Vo, and Wolfe (2013) replicated this with expert radiologists searching lung CT scans for cancer nodules. A gorilla image was embedded in the scans (48 times larger than average nodule). 83% of radiologists failed to detect the gorilla, with eye-tracking showing many looked directly at it without conscious awareness.

### Factors Affecting Inattentional Blindness

**Task Demands:** Higher cognitive load increases blindness; dual-task situations are particularly problematic.

**Expectation:** Expected events are more likely to be detected; warning that something unexpected may occur substantially reduces blindness.

**Individual Differences:** Working memory capacity shows modest correlation with detection; expertise paradoxically may increase blindness for unexpected stimuli.

### Real-World Consequences

- Aviation: Pilots can fail to see aircraft on collision course
- Driving: "Looked but failed to see" accidents are common
- Medical: Radiologists miss embedded abnormalities during focused procedures

A witness who reports seeing "nothing unusual" while focused on a task may have been literally blind to unusual events. This is not deception or negligence - it is a fundamental property of human perception.

## 3. Change Blindness Research

Change blindness is the failure to detect substantial changes in a visual scene when the change coincides with a visual disruption. This phenomenon reveals that we do not maintain detailed representations of our environment.

### Classic Demonstrations

Rensink, O'Regan, and Clark (1997) demonstrated the flicker paradigm: two images alternated with a brief blank screen between. Changes could be large (buildings disappearing, colours changing), yet participants took surprisingly long to detect them.

Simons and Levin (1998) conducted a striking real-world study: an experimenter asked pedestrians for directions, and during the interaction, workers carrying a door walked between them. Behind the door, a different person replaced the experimenter. 50% of participants failed to notice the person change.

### Mechanism

Visual disruptions (saccades, blinks, film cuts, brief occlusions) mask the transient signal that normally indicates change location. Without this signal, change must be detected through comparison, but detailed scene representations are not maintained for comparison.

### Applied Contexts

- **Eyewitness testimony:** Witnesses may not notice perpetrator changes in clothing or accessories
- **Security screening:** Screeners can miss items appearing between scans
- **Medical monitoring:** Display changes during attention shifts may be missed

When institutional records show different details across documents, this may not indicate falsification. Observers genuinely perceive different details based on when they attended to the scene.

## 4. Top-Down vs Bottom-Up Attention

Attention is controlled by two interacting systems: goal-directed (top-down) and stimulus-driven (bottom-up) processes.

### Bottom-Up Attention

Bottom-up attention is captured automatically by salient stimulus properties: sudden onsets, abrupt motion, high contrast, bright colours, and looming stimuli. Itti and Koch (2000) proposed that the visual system computes salience maps based on local feature contrast, guiding initial fixations.

### Top-Down Attention

Top-down attention is directed voluntarily toward task-relevant information based on current goals and expectations. Attention can be configured to favour certain features; searching for red targets facilitates processing of all red items but can cause blindness to non-target stimuli.

### Competition and Interaction

Posner (1980) demonstrated that valid cues speed responses while invalid cues slow them. Salient distractors compete with goal-directed attention; executive control can inhibit capture but requires resources. Under load, bottom-up capture increases.

**Forensic Implications:** What an observer was trying to do powerfully shapes what they perceive. An inspector looking for one type of violation may miss another. Understanding the observer's task and expectations is essential for evaluating their observational evidence.

## 5. Attentional Blink and Bottleneck Theories

When attention is engaged with one stimulus, there is a temporary period during which subsequent stimuli are poorly processed.

### The Phenomenon

Raymond, Shapiro, and Arnell (1992) demonstrated the attentional blink using rapid serial visual presentation. When a second target appears 200-500ms after the first, detection is severely impaired, recovering by approximately 700ms.

### Bottleneck Mechanism

Chun and Potter (1995) proposed a two-stage model: Stage 1 involves rapid detection and identification (parallel); Stage 2 involves consolidation into working memory (serial, limited). The second target is detected in Stage 1 but decays before Stage 2 processing becomes available.

### Practical Contexts

- Security monitoring of multiple rapid events
- Witnessing sequences of actions in fights or accidents
- Professional monitoring of multiple indicators

When witnesses report only one of two rapid events, this is consistent with attentional blink. The second event may have been visible but unable to reach conscious awareness.

## 6. Neural Correlates of Attention

Attention is implemented by distributed brain networks, understanding which illuminates both capabilities and limitations.

### Frontoparietal Networks

Corbetta and Shulman (2002) identified two attention networks:

**Dorsal Attention Network:** Intraparietal sulcus and frontal eye fields; involved in top-down, goal-directed attention.

**Ventral Attention Network:** Temporoparietal junction and ventral frontal cortex; involved in bottom-up, stimulus-driven reorienting; right-hemisphere dominant.

### Prefrontal and Parietal Contributions

The prefrontal cortex maintains task goals, inhibits irrelevant information, and resolves competition between stimuli. Prefrontal function degrades under stress, fatigue, and intoxication. The parietal cortex computes salience maps and directs spatial attention; damage produces hemispatial neglect.

### Forensic Implications

Observers under stress have compromised prefrontal function. Fatigued observers show degraded attentional control. These are neurological limitations, not character failings, and should inform evidence evaluation.

## 7. Implications for Eyewitness Reliability

Attentional limitations compound the memory limitations discussed in [Memory Reliability](./01-memory-reliability.md). What was never attended cannot be remembered.

### The Attention-Memory Pipeline

1. Attention selects what enters processing
2. Only attended information is deeply encoded
3. Encoding quality determines memory quality
4. Retrieval cannot recover what was never encoded

Memory failures often originate as attention failures. A witness who "forgets" a detail may never have perceived it.

### Weapon Focus Effect

Loftus et al. (1987) demonstrated that witnesses to crimes involving weapons show impaired memory for peripheral details. The weapon captures attention through threat salience, leaving fewer resources for the perpetrator's face and other details. Any attention-capturing stimulus produces analogous effects.

### Evaluation Guidelines

**Questions for assessment:** What was the witness's attentional focus? Were there attention-capturing stimuli present? Was the witnessed detail central or peripheral? Were there rapid sequential events?

**Reliability hierarchy:** Directly attended information > peripherally attended; expected events > unexpected; slow sequences > rapid; single-task > dual-task observation.

## 8. Professional Implications: Medical Imaging and Security Screening

Two professional domains illustrate practical consequences of attentional limitations.

### Radiological Search

Radiologists examine complex images for rare targets under time pressure. Error types include scanning errors (abnormality never fixated), recognition errors (fixated but not recognised), and decision errors (recognised but misinterpreted).

**Satisfaction of search:** When one abnormality is found, detection of subsequent abnormalities is impaired as search terminates prematurely.

### Security Screening

Security screeners face extremely low target prevalence, which dramatically increases miss rates. The prevalence effect causes screeners to develop liberal response criteria. Vigilance decrements degrade performance over extended shifts.

### System Design Implications

When professionals miss critical information, analysts should consider: Was the missed information within attentional capacity? Were there attention-capturing competing demands? Does the system design account for human limitations? This reflects system design, not necessarily individual negligence.

---

## 9. Observational Failures in Institutional Contexts

Institutions can develop systematic blind spots analogous to individual inattentional blindness.

### Institutional Blindness Patterns

**Attentional set effects:** Institutional focus on certain metrics blinds to others; regulatory inspection templates determine what is noticed.

**Expectation effects:** Institutions notice expected problems, miss unexpected ones; novel failure modes go systematically undetected.

**Load effects:** Resource constraints increase attentional load; overloaded staff miss information they would otherwise catch.

### Cascade Effects

As described in [CASCADE Theory](../foundations/cascade-theory.md), attentional failures can initiate or amplify institutional cascades: initial warning signs not perceived, changes in situation not detected, and information from different sources not connected.

### Distinguishing Negligence from Limitation

- **Negligence:** Failure despite adequate attentional resources
- **Limitation:** Failure due to exceeded attentional capacity

The distinction matters for accountability assessment.

## 10. Connection to Phronesis Platform

Attention science directly informs Phronesis platform capabilities.

### Omission Detection Engine

Distinguishes intentional omissions from attentional failures; assesses whether omitted information was within observers' attentional scope; flags patterns suggesting systematic attentional blind spots.

### Contradiction Engine

Interprets inconsistencies appropriately: observers attending to different aspects produce different reports; INTER_DOC contradictions may reflect different observer foci rather than deception.

### Accountability Audit Engine

Assesses whether institutional design exceeded human attentional capacity; evaluates whether duty-holders were given adequate attentional resources; determines whether patterns suggest individual or systemic failure.

### Integration with Memory Analysis

Combined with [Memory Reliability](./01-memory-reliability.md) assessment: attention determines encoding quality; unattended information is not reliably encoded; both systems must be assessed for complete evidence evaluation.

---

## 11. Practical Guidelines

### Evaluation Protocol

1. Identify the observer's task and focus
2. Assess attentional demands of the situation
3. Consider expectation effects
4. Evaluate temporal factors (rapid sequences, vigilance periods)
5. Account for state factors (stress, fatigue, intoxication)
6. Compare across observers for patterns
7. Assess system design against human capacity

### Reporting Standards

- Acknowledge inherent limitations of human attention
- Distinguish attended from unattended information
- Consider alternative attentional explanations for omissions
- Avoid equating "not reported" with "did not occur"
- Weight observational evidence by attentional conditions
