<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>When information passes from one institution to another, it does not remain static. Claims undergo systematic transformation---amplification, reduction, distortion, and sometimes complete inversion---as they cross institutional boundaries. These mutations are not random; they follow predictable patterns driven by summarisation constraints, template requirements, professional framing conventions, and the cognitive biases of successive handlers.</p>
<p>This article examines the mechanisms of narrative drift, drawing on Bartlett&#39;s foundational work on serial reproduction, modern communication theory, and empirical studies of institutional document chains. We demonstrate that even without deliberate manipulation, claims can undergo profound transformation through ordinary institutional processes---a phenomenon with serious implications for accuracy, accountability, and justice.</p>
<p><strong>Core finding</strong>: The cumulative effect of individually defensible editorial choices can produce claims bearing little resemblance to their evidential origins. Detecting these transformations requires systematic comparison across document boundaries, tracking not just what is said but what was lost in transmission.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction-the-telephone-game-of-institutions">1. Introduction: The Telephone Game of Institutions</h2>
<p>In 1932, British psychologist Frederic Bartlett published <em>Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology</em>, documenting how stories transform when passed from person to person. His serial reproduction experiments showed that information does not simply degrade---it transforms in predictable ways. Details are levelled (reduced), sharpened (emphasised), and assimilated (made to fit pre-existing schemas).</p>
<p>Institutional document chains exhibit the same phenomena, but with additional mechanisms: professional templates that constrain expression, time pressures that enforce brevity, and authority gradients that favour certain interpretations. When a police report becomes a social work assessment, which becomes a CAFCASS analysis, which becomes a threshold document, which becomes judicial findings---each transition creates opportunities for mutation.</p>
<p>Understanding these transformations is essential for any serious analysis of institutional documents. A claim that appears in a court judgment may have originated as speculation, been amplified through repetition, and accumulated authority through institutional endorsement---all while drifting progressively further from any evidential foundation.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-theoretical-foundations">2. Theoretical Foundations</h2>
<h3 id="21-bartletts-serial-reproduction">2.1 Bartlett's Serial Reproduction</h3>
<p>Bartlett&#39;s experiments involved passing stories through chains of participants, each reproducing the story from memory for the next. He identified three primary transformation processes:</p>
<p><strong>Levelling</strong>: Details are progressively eliminated. Information considered peripheral, unfamiliar, or inconvenient disappears from successive reproductions. In institutional contexts, qualifications, uncertainties, and contextual nuances are particularly vulnerable to levelling---they complicate narratives and do not fit standard templates.</p>
<p><strong>Sharpening</strong>: Certain elements become more prominent and exaggerated. Details that fit the recipient&#39;s expectations or that are emotionally salient become more central to each reproduction. In institutional documents, concerning behaviours are sharpened while ordinary or positive behaviours are levelled.</p>
<p><strong>Assimilation</strong>: Stories are transformed to fit pre-existing schemas and cultural expectations. Material that does not fit familiar patterns is either omitted or altered to conform. Institutional assimilation occurs when information is reframed to fit professional categories, legal standards, or organisational narratives.</p>
<p><em>Application</em>: A witness statement describing a &quot;heated discussion where voices were raised&quot; may level through institutional transmission as: police report (&quot;verbal altercation&quot;) to social work assessment (&quot;aggressive behaviour&quot;) to court summary (&quot;documented aggression&quot;). Each transition involves defensible interpretive choices; cumulatively, a discussion has become aggression.</p>
<h3 id="22-information-compression-and-loss">2.2 Information Compression and Loss</h3>
<p>Claude Shannon&#39;s information theory provides a mathematical framework for understanding transmission loss. Any communication channel has finite capacity; when information exceeds capacity, some must be discarded. Institutional documents operate under severe compression constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Page limits</strong>: Court bundles, regulatory submissions, and assessments have practical length restrictions</li>
<li><strong>Time pressure</strong>: Professionals write under deadline, forcing rapid summarisation</li>
<li><strong>Attention economics</strong>: Decision-makers cannot read everything; summaries must be brief</li>
<li><strong>Template constraints</strong>: Standard forms provide limited space for nuance</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The compression problem</em>: When a 50-page clinical report must be summarised in two paragraphs for a threshold document, what is retained and what is lost? The answer is not neutral---it reflects the summariser&#39;s priorities, interpretive framework, and (often unconscious) biases.</p>
<h3 id="23-narrative-theory-and-institutional-storytelling">2.3 Narrative Theory and Institutional Storytelling</h3>
<p>Narrative theorists from Ricoeur to Bruner have demonstrated that humans understand experience through stories. Institutions are no different; they construct narratives to explain, justify, and communicate their actions. But narrative construction is inherently selective---stories require protagonists and antagonists, beginnings and endings, causal chains and moral implications.</p>
<p><strong>Narrative templates in institutional contexts</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Child protection: &quot;risk identification and intervention&quot;</li>
<li>Criminal justice: &quot;investigation, prosecution, adjudication&quot;</li>
<li>Mental health: &quot;assessment, diagnosis, treatment&quot;</li>
<li>Regulatory: &quot;complaint, investigation, finding&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Each template creates pressure to fit information into expected narrative shapes, discarding material that does not advance the story.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: A family law case file may contain hundreds of pages documenting ordinary family life punctuated by a few concerning incidents. The narrative template &quot;risk to child&quot; directs attention to concerning incidents while levelling the broader context. The resulting narrative positions the incidents as central rather than anomalous.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-mechanisms-of-narrative-drift">3. Mechanisms of Narrative Drift</h2>
<h3 id="31-summarisation-loss">3.1 Summarisation Loss</h3>
<p>Every time a document is summarised, information is lost. But the loss is not random---it is systematically directional.</p>
<p><strong>What survives summarisation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claims aligned with the summariser&#39;s hypothesis</li>
<li>Information that fits professional templates</li>
<li>Dramatic or emotionally salient details</li>
<li>Material supporting the summariser&#39;s role (e.g., risk identification for social workers)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is lost in summarisation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualifications and uncertainties</li>
<li>Context explaining behaviour</li>
<li>Information contradicting the emerging narrative</li>
<li>Mundane details that would normalise the picture</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The summarisation cascade</em>: Each summarisation builds on prior summarisations. A 100-page assessment becomes a 10-page report becomes a 2-page summary becomes a single paragraph in findings. At each stage, the same directional pressures apply, compounding the distortion.</p>
<h3 id="32-qualifier-erosion">3.2 Qualifier Erosion</h3>
<p>Epistemic qualifiers---words indicating uncertainty, conditionality, or limitation---are particularly vulnerable to erosion across institutional boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Common qualifier erosion patterns</strong>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Origin</th>
<th>After 1 transmission</th>
<th>After 2+ transmissions</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>&quot;May indicate&quot;</td>
<td>&quot;Indicates&quot;</td>
<td>&quot;Shows&quot;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&quot;Possible&quot;</td>
<td>&quot;Probable&quot;</td>
<td>[Omitted - treated as fact]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&quot;One report suggests&quot;</td>
<td>&quot;Reports suggest&quot;</td>
<td>&quot;It is known that&quot;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&quot;Alleged&quot;</td>
<td>&quot;Reported&quot;</td>
<td>&quot;Confirmed&quot;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&quot;In these particular circumstances&quot;</td>
<td>&quot;In such circumstances&quot;</td>
<td>[General claim]</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Why qualifiers erode</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>They complicate narratives</li>
<li>They signal weakness to adversarial readers</li>
<li>Professional culture values confidence over uncertainty</li>
<li>Templates have no field for &quot;degree of certainty&quot;</li>
<li>Each new author slightly strengthens inherited claims</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Example</em>: A clinical psychologist writes: &quot;The child&#39;s presentation may be consistent with anxiety related to the family situation, though other explanations including developmental factors cannot be excluded.&quot; This becomes in a social work report: &quot;Psychological assessment found child&#39;s anxiety is related to the family situation.&quot; The qualification has vanished.</p>
<h3 id="33-emphasis-shifts">3.3 Emphasis Shifts</h3>
<p>What is emphasised changes systematically as documents cross boundaries. Each professional reads the same source material but highlights different aspects.</p>
<p><strong>Professional emphasis patterns</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Police: Criminal behaviour, evidence of offences, risk to public</li>
<li>Social workers: Risk factors, child welfare concerns, parenting capacity</li>
<li>Medical professionals: Symptoms, diagnoses, treatment implications</li>
<li>Legal professionals: Admissible evidence, legal standards, procedural compliance</li>
</ul>
<p>When a police report feeds into a social work assessment, police emphasis on criminal matters is retained while procedural protections (cautions, legal advice taken) may be omitted as irrelevant to the social work focus. The emphasis shift is not malicious; it reflects different professional concerns. But the cumulative effect can be profound distortion.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: Police notes record that &quot;subject exercised right to legal advice and made no comment on solicitor&#39;s instructions.&quot; Social work assessment records that &quot;subject was uncooperative with police investigation.&quot; Both are technically defensible characterisations; the emphasis shift changes the meaning entirely.</p>
<h3 id="34-context-stripping">3.4 Context Stripping</h3>
<p>Context---the circumstances explaining why something happened---is particularly vulnerable to loss in institutional transmission.</p>
<p><strong>Types of context routinely lost</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temporal: &quot;During a period of acute stress following bereavement&quot;</li>
<li>Situational: &quot;In response to provocation from the other party&quot;</li>
<li>Systemic: &quot;After multiple failed attempts to obtain support from services&quot;</li>
<li>Cultural: &quot;Consistent with practices in the subject&#39;s community&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why context is stripped</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It complicates straightforward narratives</li>
<li>It may appear to excuse or minimise concerning behaviour</li>
<li>Professional templates focus on behaviour, not context</li>
<li>Word limits force prioritisation</li>
<li>Risk-averse culture favours recording concerns over explanations</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Example</em>: A parent shouts at a social worker. The incident report records: &quot;Parent was verbally aggressive towards SW.&quot; Lost context: the visit occurred on the anniversary of the parent&#39;s child being removed, the parent had been told conflicting information by different professionals, and the parent had been waiting three hours due to scheduling error. Without context, the incident characterises the parent; with context, it characterises the situation.</p>
<h3 id="35-template-effects-and-boilerplate">3.5 Template Effects and Boilerplate</h3>
<p>Institutional documents are rarely written from scratch. They populate templates, check boxes, and draw on standard phrases (boilerplate). These structural features drive standardisation but also mutation.</p>
<p><strong>Template-driven mutation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complex situations must fit predetermined categories</li>
<li>Continuous variables become binary (risk present/absent)</li>
<li>Nuanced assessments become checkbox selections</li>
<li>Rich qualitative information is discarded when no template field exists</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Boilerplate drift</strong>:
Standard phrases become detached from their original meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Concerns have been raised&quot; (by whom? about what specifically?)</li>
<li>&quot;Appropriate steps were taken&quot; (what steps? why appropriate?)</li>
<li>&quot;In the professional judgment of...&quot; (based on what evidence?)</li>
</ul>
<p>These phrases carry apparent authority but often mask absence of specific information.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: A threshold document states: &quot;The parents have failed to engage with services.&quot; This boilerplate phrase may mean anything from &quot;missed one appointment due to work conflict&quot; to &quot;deliberately evaded contact over months.&quot; The phrase survives cross-examination because its vagueness is defensible; but it conveys different implications to different readers.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-authority-accumulation-through-repetition">4. Authority Accumulation Through Repetition</h2>
<h3 id="41-the-repetition-truth-effect">4.1 The Repetition-Truth Effect</h3>
<p>Psychological research demonstrates that repeated exposure to a claim increases its perceived truth, regardless of its actual veracity. Hasher, Goldstein, and Toppino (1977) established this &quot;illusory truth effect,&quot; which has been replicated extensively.</p>
<p>In institutional contexts, claims repeated across multiple documents are perceived as more authoritative, even when all instances trace to a single origin. This creates a mechanism for authority accumulation independent of evidential quality.</p>
<p><strong>The repetition pathway</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Claim originates in Document A</li>
<li>Document B cites Document A, repeating the claim</li>
<li>Document C cites both A and B, noting the claim &quot;appears in multiple sources&quot;</li>
<li>Document D treats the claim as &quot;established&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>No new evidence has been introduced, yet the claim has gained apparent corroboration.</p>
<h3 id="42-circular-citation-and-false-corroboration">4.2 Circular Citation and False Corroboration</h3>
<p>False corroboration occurs when multiple documents citing the same original source are treated as independent confirmation. This is particularly common when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different institutions receive the same referral and produce parallel reports</li>
<li>A single source document feeds multiple downstream assessments</li>
<li>Agencies share information that then &quot;returns&quot; via another route</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The circular citation trap</em>: Police share information with social services. Social services include it in their assessment. The assessment is shared with health services. Health services produce a report containing the information. Police then cite the health report as &quot;corroboration&quot; of their original intelligence. The information has gained apparent multi-agency validation despite having a single origin.</p>
<p><em>Detection method</em>: Track claim provenance through document chains. Genuine corroboration requires independent evidential paths to the same conclusion; false corroboration shows claims converging from a common source.</p>
<h3 id="43-institutional-endorsement-effects">4.3 Institutional Endorsement Effects</h3>
<p>Each time an institution adopts a claim, it adds its institutional authority. A claim in a police report carries police authority; if adopted by social services, it carries both police and social services authority; if adopted by a court, it carries judicial authority.</p>
<p>This authority accumulation is independent of verification. The court may simply have deferred to social services&#39; professional judgment, who deferred to police&#39;s investigative expertise. No institution independently verified the claim, yet it now carries the authority of all three.</p>
<p><strong>The authority laundering cascade</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speculation in an initial referral</li>
<li>Becomes &quot;allegation&quot; in police report</li>
<li>Becomes &quot;reported concern&quot; in social work assessment</li>
<li>Becomes &quot;substantiated concern&quot; in expert report</li>
<li>Becomes &quot;finding of fact&quot; in court judgment</li>
</ul>
<p>Each transition adds institutional endorsement; none adds verification.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-serial-reproduction-effects-in-multi-agency-contexts">5. Serial Reproduction Effects in Multi-Agency Contexts</h2>
<h3 id="51-the-institutional-telephone-game">5.1 The Institutional Telephone Game</h3>
<p>When information passes through multiple agencies---police to social services to CAFCASS to court to expert witness and back---Bartlett&#39;s serial reproduction effects compound.</p>
<p><strong>Compounding factors</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each agency has different professional schema (assimilation varies)</li>
<li>Each has different emphasis priorities (sharpening varies)</li>
<li>Each has different template constraints (levelling varies)</li>
<li>No single actor sees the full transmission chain</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The multi-agency multiplication problem</strong>: If each transmission introduces 10% distortion, after five transmissions the cumulative distortion exceeds 40%. Small mutations at each boundary produce large cumulative drift.</p>
<h3 id="52-loss-of-return-path">5.2 Loss of Return Path</h3>
<p>In human serial reproduction, participants could theoretically return to the source to verify. In institutional contexts, return paths are often blocked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original evidence is not shared, only summaries</li>
<li>Referrers may be anonymous or unavailable</li>
<li>Documents cite other documents rather than primary evidence</li>
<li>Time pressure prevents verification</li>
<li>Professional courtesy discourages questioning other institutions&#39; work</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The orphaned claim</em>: A claim may circulate through institutional systems long after any path to verification has closed. Original witnesses have moved, records have been destroyed, memories have faded---but the claim lives on in documents, gaining authority through repetition.</p>
<h3 id="53-aggregation-without-integration">5.3 Aggregation Without Integration</h3>
<p>Multi-agency working often involves aggregating information without integrating it. Each agency contributes its concerns; no agency is tasked with testing the overall picture for coherence.</p>
<p><em>The aggregation problem</em>: Social services note &quot;chaotic home environment.&quot; Police note &quot;uncooperative with investigation.&quot; Health services note &quot;missed appointments.&quot; Education notes &quot;child sometimes arrives late.&quot; Each individual concern is mild; aggregated, they create a picture of profound dysfunction. But no one asks whether the same underlying factor (perhaps chronic illness, or domestic abuse by the other parent, or poverty) explains all observations. The aggregated picture is taken as establishing a pattern rather than prompting investigation of causes.</p>

<h2 id="6-detection-methods-for-narrative-transformation">6. Detection Methods for Narrative Transformation</h2>
<h3 id="61-side-by-side-comparison">6.1 Side-by-Side Comparison</h3>
<p>The most fundamental detection method is direct comparison of how the same claim appears across documents.</p>

<p>This structured comparison surfaces mutations that might otherwise pass unnoticed.</p>
<h3 id="62-provenance-tracking">6.2 Provenance Tracking</h3>
<p>For each significant claim, trace backward through the document chain to establish:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original source (who first made this claim?)</li>
<li>Evidential basis (what evidence supported it at origin?)</li>
<li>Transmission pathway (which documents propagated it?)</li>
<li>Mutation points (where did the claim change?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Claims without traceable provenance---those that appear to emerge from nowhere---warrant particular scrutiny.</p>
<h3 id="63-qualification-decay-analysis">6.3 Qualification Decay Analysis</h3>
<p>Systematically track epistemic qualifiers through document chains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flag all qualifiers in source documents</li>
<li>Track whether each qualifier survives into subsequent documents</li>
<li>Calculate qualifier decay rate across the chain</li>
<li>Identify documents where decay is particularly severe</li>
</ul>
<p>High qualifier decay indicates aggressive summarisation or deliberate amplification.</p>
<h3 id="64-missing-information-analysis">6.4 Missing Information Analysis</h3>
<p>Compare what is present in source documents against what survives into subsequent documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>What information was available but not carried forward?</li>
<li>Is the missing information directionally biased (e.g., all omissions favour one party)?</li>
<li>Are there categories of information systematically omitted (e.g., exculpatory evidence)?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Directional Bias Score quantifies this:</p>
<pre><code>Bias = (Pro-prosecution omissions - Pro-defense omissions) / Total omissions
</code></pre>
<p>A score of +1.0 indicates 100% prosecution-favoring omissions---systematic rather than random selection.</p>
<h3 id="65-cross-document-contradiction-detection">6.5 Cross-Document Contradiction Detection</h3>
<p>Narrative drift often produces contradictions between documents at different stages of the chain. Detecting these contradictions reveals mutation:</p>
<p><strong>Contradiction types indicating drift</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temporal: Event dates change between documents</li>
<li>Quantitative: Numbers shift (one incident becomes &quot;multiple&quot;)</li>
<li>Attribution: Who said or did something changes</li>
<li>Certainty: Speculation becomes fact becomes certainty</li>
<li>Scope: Specific incident becomes general pattern</li>
</ul>
<p>Automated contradiction detection engines (as implemented in Phronesis) can surface these inconsistencies across large document sets.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="7-connection-to-sam-methodology">7. Connection to S.A.M. Methodology</h2>
<p>The Systematic Adversarial Methodology provides a structured framework for detecting and analysing narrative evolution, particularly in the INHERIT and COMPOUND phases.</p>
<h3 id="71-inherit-phase-tracking-propagation-without-verification">7.1 INHERIT Phase: Tracking Propagation Without Verification</h3>
<p>The INHERIT phase specifically targets the phenomenon of institutional propagation without verification. Key questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What crossed the boundary?</strong> Which claims from Institution A appear in Institution B&#39;s documents?</li>
<li><strong>How did they cross?</strong> Verbatim quotation, paraphrase, citation, or unattributed adoption?</li>
<li><strong>Was verification performed?</strong> Did Institution B independently examine evidence, or merely defer to Institution A?</li>
<li><strong>What mutations occurred at the boundary?</strong> Compare the claim&#39;s form before and after crossing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The INHERIT analysis reveals whether apparent multi-agency corroboration reflects independent verification or mere propagation of a single source claim.</p>
<h3 id="72-compound-phase-detecting-authority-accumulation">7.2 COMPOUND Phase: Detecting Authority Accumulation</h3>
<p>The COMPOUND phase examines how claims gain spurious authority through institutional endorsement and repetition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mutation scoring</strong>: Track how claims change (amplification, distortion, emergence, reduction, inversion, ossification)</li>
<li><strong>Direction scoring</strong>: Determine whether mutations systematically favour one party</li>
<li><strong>Cumulative drift measurement</strong>: Calculate total distance from origin to current form</li>
<li><strong>Authority accumulation mapping</strong>: Show how institutional endorsements multiply apparent credibility</li>
</ul>
<p>The COMPOUND analysis demonstrates that a claim&#39;s current authority may rest on repetition and endorsement rather than evidential quality.</p>
<h3 id="73-mutation-type-classification">7.3 Mutation Type Classification</h3>
<p>S.A.M. classifies mutations into six types, each with distinct detection signatures:</p>
<p><strong>Amplification</strong>: Claim strengthened without new evidence</p>
<ul>
<li>Detection: Qualifier decay, certainty escalation, scope expansion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Distortion</strong>: Meaning altered through reframing</p>
<ul>
<li>Detection: Context stripping, emphasis shift, professional assimilation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Emergence</strong>: New claims appear without traceable source</p>
<ul>
<li>Detection: Provenance tracking failure, sudden appearance in chain</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reduction</strong>: Exculpatory elements diminished or removed</p>
<ul>
<li>Detection: Directional bias scoring, missing information analysis</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inversion</strong>: Meaning reversed from original</p>
<ul>
<li>Detection: Direct contradiction between source and derivative</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="74-integration-with-contradiction-detection">7.4 Integration with Contradiction Detection</h3>
<p>Narrative evolution analysis integrates directly with contradiction detection (see <a href="/research/interdisciplinary/01-contradiction-detection-synthesis/">Contradiction Detection Synthesis</a>). When claims mutate, they often create contradictions with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earlier versions of themselves (TEMPORAL contradiction)</li>
<li>Documents that preserved the original form (INTER_DOC contradiction)</li>
<li>The underlying evidence (EVIDENTIARY contradiction)</li>
<li>Other mutated versions that drifted differently (SCOPE_SHIFT contradiction)</li>
</ul>
<p>Contradiction detection surfaces mutations; narrative evolution analysis explains how they occurred.</p>

<h2 id="8-case-study-claim-evolution-across-a-multi-agency-chain">8. Case Study: Claim Evolution Across a Multi-Agency Chain</h2>
<p>Consider a hypothetical but realistic scenario drawn from common patterns:</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1 - Initial Referral</strong>
Neighbour calls police: &quot;I&#39;m a bit worried. I heard shouting next door last night. It might have been the TV, but I thought I should mention it.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2 - Police Log</strong>
&quot;Report received of domestic disturbance at [address]. Neighbour reports shouting heard.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mutation</em>: Uncertainty removed (&quot;might have been TV&quot;), characterisation changed (&quot;disturbance&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stage 3 - Social Services Referral</strong>
&quot;Police report domestic disturbance at address. Shouting heard by neighbour.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mutation</em>: Police source launders the claim, &quot;report&quot; suggests more formal concern</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stage 4 - Social Work Assessment</strong>
&quot;History of domestic disturbance. Verbal altercation confirmed by independent witness.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mutation</em>: Single incident becomes &quot;history,&quot; neighbour becomes &quot;independent witness,&quot; &quot;disturbance&quot; becomes &quot;verbal altercation&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stage 5 - CAFCASS Report</strong>
&quot;Documented history of verbal aggression in the home. Multiple agencies have noted concerns.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mutation</em>: &quot;Altercation&quot; becomes &quot;aggression,&quot; single incident becomes &quot;history,&quot; two documents citing same source becomes &quot;multiple agencies&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stage 6 - Threshold Document</strong>
&quot;Pattern of domestic verbal aggression. Corroborated by neighbour, police, social services, and CAFCASS.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mutation</em>: &quot;History&quot; becomes &quot;pattern,&quot; circular citation presented as independent corroboration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stage 7 - Judgment</strong>
&quot;The court finds an established pattern of verbal aggression in the home, documented and corroborated by multiple agencies.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Total drift</strong>: A neighbour&#39;s uncertain report of possible shouting (which might have been the television) has become a judicially-found pattern of verbal aggression corroborated by multiple agencies. Each transition involved defensible professional practices; the cumulative result is profound distortion.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="9-implications-for-institutional-design">9. Implications for Institutional Design</h2>
<h3 id="91-documentation-standards">9.1 Documentation Standards</h3>
<p>Institutions should implement documentation practices that resist narrative drift:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mandatory uncertainty markers</strong>: Claims must carry epistemic qualifiers that propagate through citation</li>
<li><strong>Provenance requirements</strong>: Each claim must cite specific evidence, not just prior documents</li>
<li><strong>Context preservation</strong>: Templates must include fields for contextual factors explaining behaviour</li>
<li><strong>Original language quotation</strong>: When summarising, include verbatim quotes of key claims</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="92-boundary-verification">9.2 Boundary Verification</h3>
<p>At institutional boundaries, require active verification rather than passive acceptance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source document review</strong>: Do not cite summaries; read and assess original evidence</li>
<li><strong>Independent assessment</strong>: Form conclusions before reviewing prior institutional conclusions</li>
<li><strong>Mutation checking</strong>: Compare transmitted claims against originals, flag discrepancies</li>
<li><strong>Verification documentation</strong>: Record what was independently verified versus what was adopted on trust</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="93-aggregation-protocols">9.3 Aggregation Protocols</h3>
<p>When aggregating multi-agency information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source deduplication</strong>: Track whether multiple concerns trace to single origins</li>
<li><strong>Coherence testing</strong>: Ask whether aggregated concerns might have common explanations</li>
<li><strong>Balance assessment</strong>: Require documentation of positive as well as negative information</li>
<li><strong>Directional bias checking</strong>: Calculate whether aggregated picture is systematically skewed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="10-conclusion-the-archaeology-of-claims">10. Conclusion: The Archaeology of Claims</h2>
<p>Every claim in an institutional document has a history. That history involves not just the events the claim describes, but the documentary journey the claim has taken---the summarisations, transmissions, translations, and transformations that shaped its current form.</p>
<p>Reading institutional documents with epistemic rigour requires archaeological work: digging beneath the surface of current assertions to uncover their origins, trace their mutations, and assess whether their current authority reflects evidential quality or merely accumulated endorsement.</p>
<p>The mechanisms of narrative drift---summarisation loss, qualifier erosion, emphasis shifts, context stripping, template effects, authority accumulation, and circular citation---are not occasional aberrations but systematic features of institutional information processing. Detecting their operation requires specific methods: side-by-side comparison, provenance tracking, qualification decay analysis, missing information analysis, and cross-document contradiction detection.</p>
<p>The Systematic Adversarial Methodology provides a structured framework for this work, particularly through the INHERIT phase (tracking propagation without verification) and COMPOUND phase (detecting authority accumulation and mutation). By systematically examining how claims transform across institutional boundaries, analysts can distinguish genuine multi-source corroboration from false corroboration through circular citation, and can assess whether a claim&#39;s current authority reflects the quality of its evidential foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Core principle</strong>: Claims are not static; they evolve. The claim you read in the final document may bear little resemblance to the evidence that originated it. Tracing that evolution is essential to any serious assessment of institutional truth-claims.</p>
