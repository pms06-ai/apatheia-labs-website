<h2 id="introduction-the-cascade-metaphor">Introduction: The Cascade Metaphor</h2>
<p>The term &quot;cascade&quot; evokes a waterfall - water flowing over multiple tiers, each feeding the next, gaining momentum and volume as it descends. In institutional systems, false premises exhibit similar dynamics:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Origin point</strong>: A claim enters the record (the source)</li>
<li><strong>Propagation</strong>: The claim flows to other documents and institutions (the descent)</li>
<li><strong>Accumulation</strong>: The claim gains authority through repetition (growing volume)</li>
<li><strong>Outcome</strong>: The now-authoritative claim produces consequences (the impact)</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike a waterfall, where water&#39;s nature remains constant, institutional cascades exhibit <strong>mutations</strong>: The claim changes subtly at each stage, typically becoming more certain, more general, and more consequential.</p>
<p>This document presents the formal theory of institutional cascades, the mechanisms driving propagation, the conditions enabling versus preventing cascades, and the implications for institutional design and accountability.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-the-four-phase-cascade-model">1. The Four-Phase Cascade Model</h2>
<h3 id="11-phase-definitions">1.1 Phase Definitions</h3>
<h4 id="anchor-the-origin-point">ANCHOR: The Origin Point</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The phase where a claim first enters the institutional record.</p>
<p><strong>Key questions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>What evidential basis existed at origin?</li>
<li>What certainty level was appropriate given evidence?</li>
<li>How was the claim originally framed (fact, opinion, speculation)?</li>
<li>Who originated the claim, and what was their access to evidence?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Origin types</strong> (epistemic quality spectrum):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary source</strong> (highest quality): Direct observation, contemporaneous documentation, physical evidence</li>
<li><strong>Professional opinion</strong> (high quality): Expert assessment based on examination/evidence</li>
<li><strong>Hearsay</strong> (medium quality): Report of what another observed/said</li>
<li><strong>Speculation</strong> (low quality): Inference without direct evidential grounding</li>
<li><strong>Misattribution</strong> (very low quality): Claim attributed to wrong source</li>
<li><strong>Fabrication</strong> (no quality): No traceable evidential basis</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ANCHOR phase hypothesis</strong>: Most institutional failures stem from poor-quality origins that are not acknowledged as such. A claim entered as speculation but not marked as speculative becomes indistinguishable from established fact in subsequent documents.</p>
<h4 id="inherit-propagation-without-verification">INHERIT: Propagation Without Verification</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The phase where claims propagate from origin to subsequent documents, typically without independent verification.</p>
<p><strong>Key mechanisms</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verbatim copying</strong>: Exact reproduction (preserves original but may propagate errors)</li>
<li><strong>Paraphrase</strong>: Semantic preservation with lexical changes (risk of mutation)</li>
<li><strong>Citation</strong>: Reference to source document (transfers authority of source)</li>
<li><strong>Implicit adoption</strong>: Treating claim as fact without attribution (obscures origin)</li>
<li><strong>Circular reference</strong>: Mutual citation loops (creates false appearance of multiple sources)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verification status</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verified</strong>: Recipient independently examines evidence, confirms claim</li>
<li><strong>Partially verified</strong>: Recipient checks some aspects but not all</li>
<li><strong>Unverified assumed</strong>: Recipient assumes sender verified (deference)</li>
<li><strong>Unverified intentional</strong>: Recipient knows claim unverified but repeats anyway</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>INHERIT phase hypothesis</strong>: Institutional structures incentivize <em>assuming</em> verification occurred elsewhere rather than conducting independent verification. Reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time/resource constraints</li>
<li>Authority deference (trust in sending institution&#39;s competence)</li>
<li>Liability aversion (challenging claims creates friction)</li>
<li>Organizational culture (questioning seen as uncooperative)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="compound-authority-accumulation">COMPOUND: Authority Accumulation</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The phase where repeated institutional endorsements cause claims to accumulate authority independent of evidential quality.</p>
<p><strong>Authority sources</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Positional authority</strong>: Judge, doctor, licensed professional (credentials)</li>
<li><strong>Institutional authority</strong>: Court, regulatory agency, professional body (organization)</li>
<li><strong>Repetition-based authority</strong>: Multiple documents assert claim (frequency)</li>
<li><strong>Consensus authority</strong>: Multiple professionals agree (corroboration)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Authority laundering</strong> (core phenomenon):</p>
<p>A weakly-founded claim gains spurious authority through institutional processing:</p>
<pre><code>Low authority origin (speculation)
  → Medium authority adoption (professional assessment)
  → High authority endorsement (official report)
  → Highest authority determination (court finding)
</code></pre>
<p>At each step:</p>
<ul>
<li>Institutional actor may reasonably assume prior actors verified</li>
<li>Each repetition adds authority weight</li>
<li>Origin&#39;s poor evidential quality is forgotten</li>
<li>Final determination has high authority despite weak foundation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>COMPOUND phase hypothesis</strong>: Authority accumulates <strong>multiplicatively</strong> (each endorsement amplifies prior authority) rather than additively, creating non-linear authority growth. A claim endorsed by court carries vastly more weight than same claim in initial report, even if court merely deferred to report without independent assessment.</p>
<h4 id="arrive-outcome-causation">ARRIVE: Outcome Causation</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The phase where authority-laden false premises contribute to harmful outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome types</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal</strong>: Court orders (removal, incarceration, termination of rights)</li>
<li><strong>Administrative</strong>: Agency decisions (benefit denial, license revocation)</li>
<li><strong>Clinical</strong>: Medical decisions (diagnosis, treatment, commitment)</li>
<li><strong>Reputational</strong>: Media characterizations, professional sanctions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Causation analysis</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>But-for causation</strong>: Would outcome have occurred without false premise?</li>
<li><strong>Substantial factor</strong>: Did false premise materially contribute even if not necessary?</li>
<li><strong>Chain analysis</strong>: Tracing premise → propagation → authority → outcome</li>
<li><strong>Multiple causation</strong>: When multiple false premises jointly support outcome</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Harm assessment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Catastrophic</strong>: Irreversible, life-destroying (wrongful execution, permanent separation)</li>
<li><strong>Severe</strong>: Major, long-lasting (wrongful incarceration, chronic medical harm)</li>
<li><strong>Moderate</strong>: Substantial but potentially remedied (temporary custody loss, incorrect treatment)</li>
<li><strong>Minor</strong>: Limited duration and scope (procedural delays, minor errors)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ARRIVE phase hypothesis</strong>: Institutional systems lack effective feedback from outcomes to origins. When harmful outcomes occur, attention focuses on proximate causes (final decision) rather than ultimate causes (poor-quality origin). This breaks the learning loop that would improve origin quality.</p>
<h3 id="12-phase-interactions-and-feedbacks">1.2 Phase Interactions and Feedbacks</h3>
<p><strong>Forward cascades</strong> (origin → outcome):</p>
<ul>
<li>Poor origin quality → unverified propagation → spurious authority → harmful outcome</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Backward loops</strong> (that should exist but often don&#39;t):</p>
<ul>
<li>Harmful outcome → investigation → origin quality assessment → procedural reforms</li>
<li>Authority laundering detection → institutional learning → verification requirements</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amplifying factors</strong> (accelerate cascades):</p>
<ul>
<li>Time pressure (faster propagation, less verification)</li>
<li>Institutional complexity (more handoffs, more opportunities for unverified adoption)</li>
<li>Authority gradients (steep hierarchies increase deference)</li>
<li>Liability cultures (defensive documentation, avoiding challenges)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dampening factors</strong> (slow or prevent cascades):</p>
<ul>
<li>Verification requirements at institutional boundaries</li>
<li>Adversarial challenge (defense attorneys, patient advocates, appeals)</li>
<li>Transparency (accessible records enable external review)</li>
<li>Accountability (consequences for propagating unverified claims)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-mechanisms-of-propagation">2. Mechanisms of Propagation</h2>
<h3 id="21-structural-mechanisms">2.1 Structural Mechanisms</h3>
<h4 id="organizational-silos">Organizational Silos</h4>
<p>Modern institutions operate in specialized silos with limited communication:</p>
<ul>
<li>Police → Social Services → Court → Foster Care</li>
<li>Primary Care → Specialist → Hospital → Rehabilitation</li>
<li>Investigation → Prosecution → Trial → Sentencing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cascade acceleration at boundaries</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each silo has specialized expertise in its domain but limited expertise in others</li>
<li>Receiving silo assumes sending silo competent in its domain</li>
<li>Verification would require crossing expertise boundaries (costly, difficult)</li>
<li>Result: Claims propagate across boundaries with minimal verification</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Police report contains speculation about mental health. Social worker reads police report, assumes police assessment is reliable, adopts claim. Psychologist reads social worker&#39;s report, assumes social worker verified, adopts claim. Court reads psychologist&#39;s report, assumes clinical assessment, relies on claim. At no point did anyone with mental health expertise directly assess the individual - claim propagated through deference chain.</p>
<h4 id="information-asymmetry">Information Asymmetry</h4>
<p><strong>Structural asymmetry</strong>: Institutional actors have access to documents but not to original evidence.</p>
<p>When social worker reads police report, social worker sees:</p>
<ul>
<li>What police wrote</li>
<li>NOT: What police observed</li>
<li>NOT: What evidence exists</li>
<li>NOT: What police omitted</li>
</ul>
<p>This asymmetry enables cascades because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recipient cannot independently verify claims</li>
<li>Recipient must trust sender&#39;s characterization</li>
<li>Sender&#39;s framing shapes recipient&#39;s understanding</li>
<li>Original evidence becomes inaccessible over time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Temporal dimension</strong>: As time passes, access to original evidence degrades:</p>
<ul>
<li>Witnesses&#39; memories fade</li>
<li>Physical evidence degrades or is lost</li>
<li>Participants become unavailable</li>
<li>Documents become canonical - what&#39;s written replaces what happened</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="procedural-entrenchment">Procedural Entrenchment</h4>
<p>Institutional procedures create path dependencies:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initial determination</strong>: First formal determination has special status</li>
<li><strong>Burden of proof</strong>: Challenging initial determination requires showing error</li>
<li><strong>Finality</strong>: Decisions reach points where further review is unavailable</li>
<li><strong>Res judicata</strong>: Legal doctrines prevent re-litigating settled matters</li>
</ol>
<p>These doctrines serve legitimate purposes (efficiency, stability, preventing endless re-litigation) but also entrench errors. Once claim is formally determined, overturning requires meeting high burden even if determination rested on poor-quality origin.</p>
<h3 id="22-cognitive-mechanisms">2.2 Cognitive Mechanisms</h3>
<h4 id="confirmation-bias-in-documentation">Confirmation Bias in Documentation</h4>
<p><strong>Initial framing effect</strong>: First document that frames an issue shapes subsequent documents.</p>
<p>If initial report characterizes situation as &quot;child abuse,&quot; subsequent documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek and record information consistent with abuse frame</li>
<li>Discount or omit information inconsistent with abuse frame</li>
<li>Interpret ambiguous information as supporting abuse frame</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Selective attention</strong>: Once narrative is established, actors notice and document information fitting narrative while overlooking contradicting information.</p>
<p><strong>Narrative coherence</strong>: Human minds seek coherent stories. Contradictions create cognitive dissonance. Institutional actors unconsciously smooth contradictions to maintain narrative coherence.</p>
<h4 id="authority-heuristic">Authority Heuristic</h4>
<p><strong>Mental shortcut</strong>: When lacking expertise or time, defer to authority.</p>
<p>This is often reasonable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-expert <em>should</em> defer to genuine expert</li>
<li>Efficiency requires trusting some sources</li>
</ul>
<p>But institutional cascades exploit this heuristic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authority (credentials, position) substitutes for evidence quality</li>
<li>&quot;Expert said X&quot; treated as evidence for X rather than claim requiring scrutiny</li>
<li>Chain of authority: A trusts B trusts C trusts D, but no one verified</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Credibility transfer</strong>: Source credibility in one domain transfers to other domains.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. X is respected physician → Dr. X&#39;s opinion about non-medical matters treated as authoritative</li>
<li>Agency A is competent in Domain 1 → Agency A&#39;s claims about Domain 2 trusted</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anchoring-bias">Anchoring Bias</h4>
<p><strong>First number becomes anchor</strong>: Initial assessments disproportionately influence subsequent assessments.</p>
<p>In institutional cascades:</p>
<ul>
<li>First document&#39;s characterization becomes anchor</li>
<li>Later documents adjust from anchor rather than independent assessment</li>
<li>Even if later documents &quot;correct,&quot; they don&#39;t fully escape anchor&#39;s influence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Initial report estimates harm severity as 7/10. Subsequent reports assess as 6/10 or 8/10 (adjusting from anchor) rather than independently determining could be 2/10 or 9/10.</p>
<h3 id="23-social-mechanisms">2.3 Social Mechanisms</h3>
<h4 id="conformity-pressure">Conformity Pressure</h4>
<p><strong>Asch experiments</strong>: People conform to group judgments even when obviously wrong.</p>
<p>Institutional conformity:</p>
<ul>
<li>When multiple documents assert claim, challenging requires going against consensus</li>
<li>Lone dissenter faces social costs (reputation as difficult, uncooperative, overly cautious)</li>
<li>Conforming is safer - if everyone agrees and outcome is bad, no individual blamed; if you dissent and outcome is bad, you&#39;re blamed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Professional socialization</strong>: Training emphasizes trusting institutional processes and colleagues. Questioning institutional determinations goes against professional norms.</p>
<h4 id="groupthink">Groupthink</h4>
<p><strong>Irving Janis</strong>: Groups seeking consensus suppress dissent and fail to consider alternatives.</p>
<p>Institutional groupthink:</p>
<ul>
<li>Case conferences seek consensus on case plan</li>
<li>Dissenting opinions seen as unhelpful, slowing process</li>
<li>Shared assumptions not questioned</li>
<li>Illusion of unanimity (silence taken as agreement)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cascade acceleration</strong>: When teams rather than individuals review claims, conformity pressure prevents verification. No single person responsible for independent check.</p>
<h4 id="reputation-and-face-saving">Reputation and Face-Saving</h4>
<p><strong>Organizational self-interest</strong>: Admitting error damages institutional reputation.</p>
<p>Once institution has publicly taken position:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reversing position suggests initial incompetence</li>
<li>Maintaining position preserves face</li>
<li>New evidence is minimized or reframed to fit established position</li>
<li>&quot;Doubling down&quot; - defending position more strongly when challenged</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates <strong>error persistence</strong>: Once false premise is officially adopted, organizational incentives favor maintaining it despite contradicting evidence.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-mutation-dynamics">3. Mutation Dynamics</h2>
<h3 id="31-types-of-mutation">3.1 Types of Mutation</h3>
<p>Claims don&#39;t propagate unchanged. They mutate during propagation. Common mutation types:</p>
<h4 id="amplification">Amplification</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Strength of claim increases without corresponding evidence increase.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanisms</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hedging language removed: &quot;possibly&quot; → &quot;probably&quot; → omitted entirely</li>
<li>Qualifiers dropped: &quot;on one occasion&quot; → &quot;sometimes&quot; → &quot;regularly&quot;</li>
<li>Uncertainty becomes certainty: &quot;may have occurred&quot; → &quot;occurred&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example cascade</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document 1: &quot;Neighbor reported hearing what might have been shouting&quot;</li>
<li>Document 2: &quot;Neighbor reported hearing shouting&quot;</li>
<li>Document 3: &quot;Witness confirmed verbal altercation&quot;</li>
<li>Document 4: &quot;Verbal altercation documented by witness statement&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Each step: small mutation, cumulatively major amplification.</p>
<h4 id="attenuation">Attenuation</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Specificity decreases, precision lost.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanisms</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific details become vague: &quot;stated X on March 5&quot; → &quot;stated X&quot;</li>
<li>Qualifications removed: &quot;according to one source&quot; → unmarked assertion</li>
<li>Context stripped: &quot;in high-stress situation&quot; → context omitted</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original context forgotten</li>
<li>Claim becomes decontextualized &quot;fact&quot;</li>
<li>Scope expands beyond original bounds</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="certainty-drift">Certainty Drift</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Epistemic confidence increases over time without new evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Repetition creates familiarity; familiarity is mistaken for truth.</p>
<p><strong>Psychological basis</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mere exposure effect: Repeated exposure increases positive evaluation</li>
<li>Availability heuristic: Easily recalled information judged as more likely true</li>
<li>Social proof: Multiple repetitions suggest multiple sources (even if same origin)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Institutional manifestation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>First document: &quot;Possible X&quot;</li>
<li>After several repetitions: &quot;As previously documented, X&quot;</li>
<li>No new evidence, but claim now treated as established fact</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="attribution-shift">Attribution Shift</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Source or responsibility attribution changes during propagation.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active → passive voice: &quot;Officer assumed X&quot; → &quot;X was believed&quot;</li>
<li>Direct → indirect: &quot;Witness said she saw Y&quot; → &quot;Y was observed&quot;</li>
<li>Personal → institutional: &quot;Dr. Smith speculated Z&quot; → &quot;Evaluation found Z&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Makes claims seem more objective, less tied to potentially fallible individuals.</p>
<h4 id="scope-expansion">Scope Expansion</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Claim&#39;s applicability broadens.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temporal: &quot;During one visit&quot; → &quot;During visits&quot; → &quot;Consistently&quot;</li>
<li>Quantitative: &quot;One instance&quot; → &quot;Several instances&quot; → &quot;Pattern&quot;</li>
<li>Generality: &quot;In this specific context&quot; → &quot;Generally&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cascade effect</strong>: Each document slightly broadens scope. Cumulative effect: narrow observation becomes sweeping characterization.</p>
<h3 id="32-mutation-mechanisms">3.2 Mutation Mechanisms</h3>
<p><strong>Linguistic compression</strong>: Documents summarize prior documents, losing nuance.</p>
<p><strong>Template effects</strong>: Standard forms with checkboxes force continuous phenomena into discrete categories.</p>
<p><strong>Audience adaptation</strong>: Documents written for different audiences (technical vs. legal vs. lay) translate claims across registers, introducing mutations.</p>
<p><strong>Memory effects</strong>: When writers recall prior documents rather than directly quoting, memory distortions introduce mutations.</p>
<p><strong>Intentional shaping</strong>: Some mutations are deliberate - strengthening claims to support desired conclusions.</p>
<h3 id="33-compound-mutations">3.3 Compound Mutations</h3>
<p><strong>Synergy</strong>: Multiple mutation types interact:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amplification + Scope Expansion: &quot;Possibly happened once&quot; → &quot;Pattern of behavior&quot;</li>
<li>Certainty Drift + Attribution Shift: &quot;I think X&quot; → &quot;X has been documented&quot;</li>
<li>Attenuation + Scope Expansion: Specific context stripped, claim generalized</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-linear effects</strong>: Small mutations at each stage produce large cumulative distortion.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-institutional-boundary-effects">4. Institutional Boundary Effects</h2>
<h3 id="41-why-boundaries-accelerate-cascades">4.1 Why Boundaries Accelerate Cascades</h3>
<p><strong>Institutional boundaries</strong> (transfer from one agency/actor to another) are critical cascade points:</p>
<h4 id="expertise-gaps">Expertise Gaps</h4>
<p>Each institution has domain expertise. At boundaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receiving institution lacks expertise to evaluate sending institution&#39;s claims</li>
<li>Must rely on trust rather than verification</li>
<li>Cannot meaningfully challenge without crossing expertise boundaries</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Court receives social worker&#39;s assessment. Judge lacks social work expertise, cannot evaluate quality of assessment, defers to professional&#39;s judgment.</p>
<h4 id="information-loss">Information Loss</h4>
<p>Documents crossing boundaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summarize rather than fully represent evidence</li>
<li>Omit process details (how assessment conducted)</li>
<li>Strip uncertainty (hedging doesn&#39;t translate well across contexts)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Multi-page clinical evaluation → one-page summary for court → single sentence in court order → citation in subsequent case</p>
<h4 id="liability-shielding">Liability Shielding</h4>
<p>Institutional boundaries create liability buffers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each institution responsible only for its own work</li>
<li>Can claim &quot;relied on other institution&#39;s expertise&quot;</li>
<li>Diffused responsibility: No single actor has end-to-end accountability</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: No one verifies false premise because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Police: &quot;We reported what we observed&quot;</li>
<li>Social worker: &quot;We relied on police report&quot;</li>
<li>Court: &quot;We deferred to social worker&#39;s professional judgment&quot;</li>
<li>Each technically defensible, but system-level failure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="42-cross-institutional-dynamics">4.2 Cross-Institutional Dynamics</h3>
<h4 id="institutional-isomorphism">Institutional Isomorphism</h4>
<p>Organizations mimic each other. If Institution A characterizes situation as X, Institution B is likely to adopt X characterization because:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mimetic isomorphism</strong>: Copying perceived successful practices</li>
<li><strong>Normative isomorphism</strong>: Professional training creates shared frameworks</li>
<li><strong>Coercive isomorphism</strong>: Legal/regulatory pressure to align</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cascade effect</strong>: Uniform characterization across institutions creates false appearance of independent corroboration.</p>
<h4 id="mutual-reinforcement">Mutual Reinforcement</h4>
<p>Institutions in same case influence each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agency A&#39;s characterization influences Agency B</li>
<li>Agency B&#39;s adoption influences Agency C</li>
<li>Agency C&#39;s endorsement feeds back to Agency A, reinforcing original</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positive feedback loop</strong>: Each institution&#39;s adoption strengthens others&#39; confidence. System-wide consensus emerges from mutual reinforcement, not from independent evidence.</p>
<h4 id="authority-gradients">Authority Gradients</h4>
<p>Some institutions have higher authority than others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Court &gt; Agency &gt; Individual</li>
<li>Licensed professional &gt; Line staff &gt; Lay person</li>
<li>Official report &gt; Informal documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>Claims flowing &quot;uphill&quot; (low to high authority):</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain authority through institutional endorsement</li>
<li>Lose nuance/uncertainty (higher authority contexts less tolerant of ambiguity)</li>

<h2 id="5-enabling-vs-preventing-conditions">5. Enabling vs. Preventing Conditions</h2>
<h3 id="51-conditions-enabling-cascades">5.1 Conditions Enabling Cascades</h3>
<p><strong>Systemic factors</strong> that facilitate false premise propagation:</p>
<h4 id="opacity">Opacity</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Lack of transparency about evidence basis, reasoning process, and uncertainties.</p>
<p>When documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t cite specific evidence</li>
<li>Don&#39;t explain reasoning from evidence to conclusion</li>
<li>Don&#39;t acknowledge limitations/uncertainties</li>
<li>Don&#39;t flag speculations as such</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: Recipients cannot assess quality, must accept or reject wholesale.</p>
<h4 id="asymmetric-resources">Asymmetric Resources</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Unequal resources between institutional actors and individuals subject to decisions.</p>
<p>Institutions have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to prepare documents</li>
<li>Legal expertise</li>
<li>Access to experts</li>
<li>Procedural knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited time/resources</li>
<li>No legal expertise</li>
<li>No access to contrary experts</li>
<li>Procedural barriers to participation</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: Institutional claims go unchallenged not because they&#39;re strong but because challenging is prohibitively costly.</p>
<h4 id="time-pressure">Time Pressure</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Institutional timelines requiring fast decisions.</p>
<p>When decisions must be made quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li>No time for thorough verification</li>
<li>Deference to prior determinations (efficiency)</li>
<li>Errors get locked in before correction possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: Speed favors propagation over verification.</p>
<h4 id="defensive-practice">Defensive Practice</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Liability-driven documentation focuses on justifying decisions rather than accurately representing uncertainties.</p>
<p>When institutions fear legal liability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documents written for legal defense, not truth</li>
<li>Hedging avoided (appears weak)</li>
<li>Uncertainties minimized (creates vulnerability)</li>
<li>Consensus emphasized (safety in numbers)</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: Documents systematically overstate certainty and minimize weaknesses.</p>
<h4 id="weak-accountability">Weak Accountability</h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Lack of consequences for propagating unverified claims.</p>
<p>When institutional actors face:</p>
<ul>
<li>No consequences for accepting false claims</li>
<li>Consequences for challenging (friction, delay, appearing uncooperative)</li>
<li>Rewards for efficiency (processing cases quickly)</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: Rational actors propagate claims without verification.</p>
<h3 id="52-conditions-preventing-cascades">5.2 Conditions Preventing Cascades</h3>
<p><strong>Systemic factors</strong> that block or slow false premise propagation:</p>
<h4 id="transparency-requirements">Transparency Requirements</h4>
<p><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Require documents to show their work.</p>
<p>Effective transparency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cite specific evidence for each claim</li>
<li>Explain reasoning from evidence to conclusion</li>
<li>Acknowledge uncertainties and limitations</li>
<li>Distinguish observation from inference</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: Recipients can evaluate quality, weak claims are identified.</p>
<h4 id="adversarial-challenge">Adversarial Challenge</h4>
<p><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Institutionalize systematic skepticism.</p>
<p>Effective adversarial processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well-resourced opposing parties</li>
<li>Access to independent experts</li>
<li>Meaningful discovery (access to underlying evidence)</li>
<li>Procedural rights to challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: Weak claims are tested and fail; strong claims survive and gain credibility through surviving challenge.</p>
<h4 id="verification-requirements">Verification Requirements</h4>
<p><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Mandate independent verification at key points.</p>
<p>Effective verification:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receiving institution cannot merely defer to sending institution</li>
<li>Must conduct independent assessment of evidence</li>
<li>Must document verification process</li>
<li>Accountability for verification failures</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: Propagation slowed, errors caught before accumulating authority.</p>
<h4 id="error-detection-systems">Error Detection Systems</h4>
<p><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Systematic review for inconsistencies and quality problems.</p>
<p>Effective detection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular audits of document chains</li>
<li>Automated contradiction detection</li>
<li>Peer review processes</li>
<li>External oversight bodies</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: Errors identified and corrected before causing harm.</p>
<h4 id="strong-accountability">Strong Accountability</h4>
<p><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Consequences for quality failures.</p>
<p>Effective accountability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track outcomes back to origins</li>
<li>Identify individual/institutional contributions to failures</li>
<li>Meaningful consequences (not just &quot;more training&quot;)</li>
<li>Protections for whistleblowers who identify problems</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: Institutional actors have incentives to verify before propagating.</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>A(c) = cumulative authority of claim c</li>
<li>wᵢ = authority weight of institution i endorsing c</li>
<li>Σᵢ = sum over all endorsing institutions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Doesn&#39;t capture non-linear effects of high-authority endorsements.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplicative model</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>A(c) = ∏ᵢ (1 + αwᵢ)
</code></pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>α = amplification factor</li>
<li>Product captures non-linear growth</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Observations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authority grows faster than linearly with endorsements</li>
<li>High-authority endorsements (large wᵢ) disproportionately increase A(c)</li>
<li>Early high-authority endorsements create path dependency</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="62-mutation-rate-model">6.2 Mutation Rate Model</h3>
<p><strong>Mutation accumulation</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>m(c, n) = m₀ + δn
</code></pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>m(c, n) = distortion of claim c after n propagations</li>
<li>m₀ = initial distortion (origin quality)</li>
<li>δ = per-propagation mutation rate</li>
<li>n = number of propagations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-linear alternative</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>m(c, n) = m₀eᵟⁿ
</code></pre>
<p>Exponential growth captures compounding distortions.</p>
<p><strong>Factors affecting δ</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document quality (high quality = lower δ)</li>
<li>Institutional boundary crossings (boundaries increase δ)</li>
<li>Time pressure (faster = higher δ)</li>
<li>Transparency (low transparency = higher δ)</li>

<h3 id="63-cascade-probability-model">6.3 Cascade Probability Model</h3>
<p><strong>Probability claim propagates</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>P(prop) = f(A(c), E(c), R)

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>P(prop) = probability claim is adopted by next institution</li>
<li>A(c) = authority of claim</li>
<li>E(c) = evidential quality</li>
<li>R = resources for verification</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: P(prop) increases with A(c), decreases with resources R for verification.</p>
<p>When R is low (time pressure, limited resources):</p>
<ul>
<li>P(prop) ≈ 1 for high A(c), regardless of E(c)</li>
<li>Authority substitutes for evidence</li>
</ul>
<p>When R is high (adequate verification resources):</p>
<ul>
<li>P(prop) depends more on E(c) than A(c)</li>
<li>Evidence quality matters</li>

<h2 id="8-implications-for-institutional-design">8. Implications for Institutional Design</h2>
<h3 id="81-design-principles-to-prevent-cascades">8.1 Design Principles to Prevent Cascades</h3>
<h4 id="principle-1-explicit-uncertainty">Principle 1: Explicit Uncertainty</h4>
<p><strong>Rule</strong>: Claims must carry uncertainty markers commensurate with evidence quality.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Required fields for evidence quality (0-100% scale)</li>
<li>Explicit tagging: [Verified], [Hearsay], [Speculation], [Hypothesis]</li>
<li>Uncertainty propagates with claims (don&#39;t strip hedging)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Makes evidential weakness visible, preventing false certainty.</p>
<h4 id="principle-2-mandatory-verification-points">Principle 2: Mandatory Verification Points</h4>
<p><strong>Rule</strong>: Independent verification required at critical decision points.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before crossing institutional boundaries</li>
<li>Before major decisions (removal, incarceration, major treatment)</li>
<li>Verification must be documented (what evidence reviewed, what confirmed)</li>
<li>Cannot merely cite prior determination</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Breaks propagation chains, catches errors before accumulating authority.</p>
<h4 id="principle-3-provenance-tracking">Principle 3: Provenance Tracking</h4>
<p><strong>Rule</strong>: Every claim must be traceable to evidential origin.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Citation to specific evidence (page, document, observation)</li>
<li>Chain of custody: Track claim through all documents</li>
<li>Automated tools to maintain provenance links</li>
<li>When claim mutates, flag divergence from origin</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Enables checking claims against original evidence, detecting mutations.</p>
<h4 id="principle-4-adversarial-safeguards">Principle 4: Adversarial Safeguards</h4>
<p><strong>Rule</strong>: Meaningful challenge must be possible and resourced.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right to independent expert</li>
<li>Access to underlying evidence (not just summaries)</li>
<li>Resources for opposition (counsel, investigation)</li>
<li>Burden on institution to prove, not on individual to disprove</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Weak claims are challenged and fail; system produces more accurate determinations.</p>
<h4 id="principle-5-error-detection-and-correction">Principle 5: Error Detection and Correction</h4>
<p><strong>Rule</strong>: Systematic review for errors, with mechanisms for correction.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular audits of document chains</li>
<li>External oversight bodies</li>
<li>Innocence projects, ombudsmen</li>
<li>When errors found, trace back to origin, identify system failures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Learning loops improve system over time.</p>
<h3 id="82-resistance-to-reform">8.2 Resistance to Reform</h3>
<p>Why are these principles not already implemented?</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency costs</strong>: Verification takes time and resources. Organizations optimized for throughput resist slowdowns.</p>
<p><strong>Liability concerns</strong>: Making uncertainty explicit feels risky (appears weak, creates litigation vulnerability).</p>
<p><strong>Professional autonomy</strong>: Requirements feel like questioning professional judgment, generate resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Institutional inertia</strong>: Existing processes are entrenched, changing requires overcoming bureaucratic momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of political will</strong>: Reforms come after crises, but crises are (individually) rare enough that urgency fades.</p>
<p><strong>Resource constraints</strong>: Verification and adversarial safeguards cost money; institutions are resource-constrained.</p>
<h3 id="83-reform-strategies">8.3 Reform Strategies</h3>
<p><strong>Pilot programs</strong>: Implement principles in limited contexts, demonstrate effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong>: Automate provenance tracking, contradiction detection (reduce manual burden).</p>
<p><strong>Professional education</strong>: Train institutional actors in epistemic responsibility, cascade dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong>: Public reporting of error rates, cascade detections (create pressure for improvement).</p>
<p><strong>Legal reform</strong>: Mandate verification requirements, admissibility standards.</p>
<p><strong>Liability reallocation</strong>: Create consequences for cascade failures, not just for visible errors.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="9-conclusion-toward-cascade-resistant-institutions">9. Conclusion: Toward Cascade-Resistant Institutions</h2>
<p>Institutional cascades are not aberrations but predictable consequences of how institutions are designed. When:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documents are opaque about evidence and uncertainty</li>
<li>Verification is costly and challenging is risky</li>
<li>Authority substitutes for evidence</li>
<li>Boundaries enable unverified propagation</li>
<li>Accountability is weak or absent</li>
</ul>
<p>False premises will propagate, accumulate spurious authority, and cause preventable harm.</p>
<p>The cascade model provides both:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnostic tool</strong>: Trace existing failures back through cascade phases</li>
<li><strong>Design framework</strong>: Build institutions resistant to cascades</li>
</ul>
<p>Cascade-resistant institutions would:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anchor carefully</strong>: Ensure high origin quality, mark uncertainty</li>
<li><strong>Verify during propagation</strong>: Require independent checks, don&#39;t just defer</li>
<li><strong>Grant authority based on evidence</strong>: Distinguish institutional position from evidential quality</li>
<li><strong>Link outcomes to origins</strong>: When harm occurs, trace back to source failures and learn</li>
</ul>
<p>Such institutions would be slower, more costly in immediate resource terms, but faster and cheaper in avoiding costly errors. The efficiency of cascade-prone institutions is false efficiency - speed bought by deferring verification creates downstream costs of correcting failures, compensating victims, and maintaining systems that systematically err.</p>
<p>True institutional efficiency would optimize for accuracy, not just throughput. The cascade model shows why accuracy requires structural features that prevent propagation of poor-quality claims. These features are not luxury add-ons but essential components of responsible institutional design.</p>
