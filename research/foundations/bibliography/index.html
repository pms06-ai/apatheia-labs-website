</ul>
<h4 id="testimony-and-trust">Testimony and Trust</h4>
<p><strong>Coady, C. A. J. (1992).</strong> <em>Testimony: A Philosophical Study</em>. Oxford University Press.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="ii-political-philosophy-and-institutional-theory">II. Political Philosophy and Institutional Theory</h3>

<p><strong>Lukes, S. (2005).</strong> <em>Power: A Radical View</em> (2nd ed.). Palgrave Macmillan.</p>
<ul>
<li>Three dimensions of power: decision-making, agenda-setting, preference-shaping. Most insidious power shapes what people want. Institutional documents exercise power partly by shaping how situations are understood.</li>

<ul>
<li>Provocative theory: Reasoning evolved for argumentation, not truth-finding. Explains why reasoning better at justifying than discovering, why people find flaws in others&#39; arguments more easily than their own. Implications for institutional decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mercier, H., &amp; Sperber, D. (2017).</strong> <em>The Enigma of Reason</em>. Harvard University Press.</p>
<ul>
<li>Book-length development of argumentative theory. Reasoning works well when multiple people with different perspectives engage in argumentation. Works poorly when no genuine adversarial challenge exists - directly supports S.A.M.&#39;s adversarial approach.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="confirmation-bias">Confirmation Bias</h4>
<p><strong>Nickerson, R. S. (1998).</strong> Confirmation bias: A ubiquitous phenomenon in many guises. <em>Review of General Psychology</em>, 2(2), 175-220.</p>

<li>People test hypotheses by seeking confirming evidence rather than potentially falsifying evidence. This strategy works in some environments but fails in others. Institutional investigations often exhibit this pattern.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Analysis of Columbia shuttle disaster shows same patterns as Challenger despite &quot;lessons learned.&quot; Why don&#39;t organizations learn? Structural factors reproduce failures even when individuals change.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion-interdisciplinary-foundations">Conclusion: Interdisciplinary Foundations</h3>
<p>This bibliography demonstrates S.A.M.&#39;s interdisciplinary foundations, drawing on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Philosophy</strong>: Epistemology, logic, political philosophy</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive science</strong>: Judgment, decision-making, reasoning</li>
<li><strong>Sociology</strong>: Institutional theory, organizations, social movements</li>
<li><strong>Safety science</strong>: Human error, system failures, high-reliability organizations</li>
<li><strong>Legal studies</strong>: Evidence, wrongful convictions, expert testimony</li>
<li><strong>Linguistics</strong>: Discourse analysis, framing, rhetoric</li>
<li><strong>Research methods</strong>: Qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods</li>
</ul>
<p>No single discipline provides complete foundation for S.A.M. The methodology synthesizes insights from multiple fields to address problems that are simultaneously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Epistemological (how do we know?)</li>
<li>Institutional (how do organizations function?)</li>
<li>Cognitive (how do individuals reason?)</li>
<li>Social (how does power operate?)</li>
<li>Practical (how to improve institutional practice?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Readers seeking deep understanding should engage multiple sections. Those focused on particular applications may prioritize relevant sections (e.g., legal practitioners focus on Sections VIII and IX; child welfare workers on Section IX; methodologists on Section X and XII).</p>
<p>The bibliography is necessarily selective - thousands more works are relevant. This collection provides entry points to major themes, with each work itself containing extensive bibliographies for further exploration.</p>
