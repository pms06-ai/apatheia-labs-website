## PEACE Interview Workflow Checklist

### P - Planning and Preparation

- [ ] Review all available evidence
- [ ] Identify information gaps and objectives
- [ ] Prepare open-ended questions (not leading)
- [ ] Consider vulnerability/special measures
- [ ] Arrange appropriate environment

### E - Engage and Explain

- [ ] Establish rapport (essential for recall)
- [ ] Explain process and legal rights
- [ ] Create psychologically safe environment
- [ ] Clarify expectations

### A - Account, Clarify, Challenge

- [ ] Obtain free narrative (uninterrupted)
- [ ] Clarify ambiguities using open questions
- [ ] Challenge inconsistencies with evidence
- [ ] Allow explanation of discrepancies

### C - Closure

- [ ] Summarize key points
- [ ] Allow additions/clarifications
- [ ] Explain next steps
- [ ] Thank interviewee

### E - Evaluation

- [ ] Assess account against evidence
- [ ] Identify corroboration opportunities
- [ ] Determine further actions
- [ ] Document outcomes
- [ ] Review interview performance

**Evidence base**: PEACE produces more reliable evidence than confrontational methods, reduces false confessions

## Chain of Custody 5-Step Protocol

**Critical**: Broken chain = evidence inadmissibility = case collapse

### Step 1: Obtain Evidence Legally

- Search warrant or legal authority documented
- Consent properly recorded
- Legal basis clear

### Step 2: Describe in Detail

- Physical description (size, color, condition)
- Location where found (precise)
- Date, time, environmental conditions
- Photographic documentation

### Step 3: Identify Accurately

- Unique identifiers/serial numbers
- Exhibit numbering system
- Label: case number + date + collector initials

### Step 4: Package Properly

- Evidence-specific packaging (paper for biological, anti-static for digital)
- Tamper-evident sealing
- Contamination prevention
- Preservation (refrigeration/secure storage)

### Step 5: Establish Chain of Custody

- Chronological possession documentation
- Transfer logs with signatures
- Storage location logs
- Access records
- Analysis documentation

**Documentation must include**: Date/time, collecting officer, receiving officer, purpose, location, condition

---

## CPIA Disclosure Requirements (Plain Language)

### Core Duty

**Disclose all material that:**

- Undermines prosecution case, OR
- Assists defence case

**Not limited to admissible evidence**

### Reasonable Lines of Enquiry

- Pursue enquiries TOWARDS suspect (inculpatory)
- Pursue enquiries AWAY FROM suspect (exculpatory)
- Document rationale for not pursuing lines

### Unused Material

- Record ALL material obtained
- Retain until case closed + appeals exhausted
- Prosecutor reviews and schedules
- Sanctions for non-disclosure: case dismissal, conviction overturn

### Key Principle

**Professional investigation ≠ advocacy**. You must gather evidence that both supports AND contradicts working hypothesis.

---

## Critical Standards (Must-Follow)

### PACE 1984 (Police and Criminal Evidence Act)

- **Arrest**: Necessity test, reasonable grounds, caution
- **Detention**: Custody officer independence, reviews every 6/9 hours, max 24 hours (36 for indictable)
- **Interviews**: Audio/video recording mandatory, legal advice right, appropriate adult for vulnerable
- **Search**: Warrant required for premises (exceptions documented)

### Professional Investigation

- **Primacy of Material**: All conclusions supported by evidence
- **Objective Evaluation**: Systematic consideration of alternatives
- **Documentation**: Contemporaneous recording of all actions/decisions
- **No Speculation**: Assumptions explicitly identified and tested

### Digital Evidence

- Forensic imaging (bit-by-bit copy)
- Hash certification (SHA-256)
- Write-blocking during acquisition
- Metadata preservation
- Analysis on copy, not original

## Common Pitfalls (Top 5)

| Mistake                      | Impact                    | Mitigation                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Confirmation bias**        | Miss exculpatory evidence | ACH methodology, test counter-hypotheses   |
| **Broken chain of custody**  | Evidence inadmissible     | Document every transfer, sealed packaging  |
| **Leading questions**        | Unreliable accounts       | PEACE training, open questions only        |
| **Disclosure failures**      | Case collapse, sanctions  | CPIA compliance, unused material schedules |
| **Inadequate documentation** | Accountability gaps       | Contemporaneous notes, decision rationale  |

### Specific Warning: Reid Technique

**DO NOT USE**: Linked to false confessions (25% of DNA exonerations), scientifically discredited behavioral analysis, not evidence-based. Use PEACE instead.

- [ ] Vulnerability assessment conducted?
- [ ] Legal advice offered/declined?
- [ ] Recording equipment tested?

### Before Charging

- [ ] Evidence meets Code for Crown Prosecutors test?
- [ ] Exculpatory evidence considered?
- [ ] CPS consulted for complex cases?
- [ ] Disclosure obligations understood?

### Before Court

- [ ] Prosecution file complete (MG forms)?
- [ ] Disclosure schedule prepared?
- [ ] Witnesses available and briefed?
- [ ] Evidence admissibility confirmed?

## IOPC Standards (External Oversight)

### When IOPC Involved

- Deaths in custody/following police contact
- Serious use of force
- Serious sexual offences by officers
- Serious corruption
- Discriminatory behavior

### Investigation Requirements

- Independence (no force involvement for serious cases)
- Evidence-based decision-making
- Organizational/systemic factors considered
- Trauma-informed approach
- Regular family updates

### Key Insight

Individual accountability + organizational accountability. Many serious incidents result from systemic failures, not merely individual error.

## Cognitive Interview Prompt Questions

**Context Reinstatement**

- "Take me back to that moment. What did you see around you?"
- "What sounds do you remember?"
- "How were you feeling at the time?"

**Report Everything**

- "Tell me everything, even if it seems unimportant."
- "Include any impressions or partial information."
- "Don't filter - just describe what you recall."

**Different Perspectives**

- "What might [other person present] have seen?"
- "If I was standing where you were, what would I have observed?"

**Different Orders**

- "Start with what you remember most clearly."
- "Now tell me what happened just before that."
- "Work backwards from the end."

**Caution**: Clearly distinguish observed facts from inferences
