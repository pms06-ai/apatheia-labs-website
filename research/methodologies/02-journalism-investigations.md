## 1. Investigation Workflows

### 1.1 Hypothesis-Based Framework

**Core Principle:** Separate verifiable facts from working assumptions to prevent confirmation bias and maintain investigative rigor.

**Structure:**

```
Investigation Hypothesis
├── Known Facts (documented, verified)
│   ├── Primary source documents
│   ├── Corroborated testimonies
│   └── Official records
├── Working Assumptions (require verification)
│   ├── Hypothesis to test
│   ├── Evidence needed
│   └── Alternative explanations
└── Open Questions
    ├── Information gaps
    ├── Contradictions to resolve
    └── Sources to develop
```

**Process:**

1. **Initial Hypothesis Formation**
   - State the investigative question clearly
   - Document known facts with sources
   - Identify assumptions requiring verification
   - List alternative explanations

2. **Evidence Prioritization**
   - Documentary evidence > testimonial evidence
   - Official documents (if authenticated) > secondary sources
   - Multiple corroborated sources > single source
   - Direct evidence > circumstantial evidence

3. **Continuous Refinement**
   - Update hypothesis as new evidence emerges
   - Document changes in understanding
   - Maintain chain of reasoning
   - Test against alternative explanations

**Example Application:**

```
Hypothesis: Official X misused public funds for personal benefit

Known Facts:
- Bank transfer records showing payments to Company Y (documents verified)
- Official X's spouse is listed as director of Company Y (corporate registry)
- Contract awarded to Company Y without competitive bidding (procurement records)

Assumptions Requiring Verification:
- Official X influenced contract award
- Company Y provided no legitimate services
- Payments exceeded market rates

Evidence Needed:
- Communication records between Official X and procurement department
- Market analysis of comparable services
- Delivery records or proof of service completion
- Official X's financial disclosure statements

Alternative Explanations to Test:
- Company Y was legitimately qualified and provided services
- Procurement followed legal exemptions
- Market rates justified the payment
- Official X had no involvement in contract decision
```

## 9. Temporal Analysis and Timeline Construction

### 9.1 Importance of Temporal Analysis

**Why Timelines Matter:**

- Reveal contradictions between accounts
- Show evolution of official narrative
- Identify gaps in documentation
- Establish causation vs. correlation
- Detect backdating or timeline manipulation
- Verify witness credibility

**Common Temporal Discrepancies:**

- Dates of knowledge vs. dates of claimed knowledge
- Sequence of events contradicting official account
- Impossible timelines (events couldn't have occurred in stated sequence)
- Backdated documents or communications
- Gaps in records during critical periods
- Post-hoc rationalizations

### 9.2 Timeline Construction Methodology

**Data Collection:**

- Extract all dates from documents
- Record date formats and time zones
- Note explicit vs. implicit dates
- Identify relative temporal references ("two weeks later", "before the meeting")
- Document metadata timestamps
- Collect witness testimony on dates

**Temporal Entity Types:**

- **Absolute Dates:** Specific calendar dates (January 15, 2020)
- **Relative Dates:** References to other events ("three days after")
- **Approximate Dates:** Ranges or uncertainties ("early 2020", "sometime in March")
- **Recurring Events:** Regular occurrences ("monthly meetings")
- **Durations:** Time spans ("three-week investigation")

**Cross-Referencing:**

- Verify dates across multiple sources
- Identify conflicting dates for same event
- Establish anchor events with certain dates
- Calculate dates from relative references
- Test timeline against external facts (e.g., person was traveling on alleged meeting date)

**Timeline Representation:**

```
Date         Event                                     Source              Confidence
----------   ----------------------------------------  ------------------  -----------
2018-01-15   Initial contract signed                   Contract Doc        Confirmed
2018-02-03   First payment transferred                 Bank Record         Confirmed
2018-03-20   Project "completed" according to report   Progress Report     Uncertain
2018-04-10   Official claims unaware of problems       Interview           Disputed
2018-04-22   Internal email shows awareness            Email (leaked)      Confirmed
2018-05-15   Public statement denying knowledge        Press Release       Inconsistent
```

### 9.3 Temporal Verification Framework

**ChronoFact Research Findings:**

- 82% of temporal verification errors due to implicit temporal information
- Explicit dates generally reliable
- Implicit dates require additional verification
- Cross-reference multiple sources for temporal claims
- Automated systems struggle with complex temporal relationships

**Verification Process:**

1. **Identify Temporal Claims**
   - Explicit: "The meeting occurred on March 15, 2019"
   - Implicit: "After the investigation concluded..."

2. **Establish Anchor Points**
   - Find events with certain, verifiable dates
   - Public events, official filings, media reports
   - Use as reference for relative dates

3. **Calculate Derived Dates**
   - Use relative references and anchors
   - Example: "Three weeks after the March 15 meeting" = ~April 5

4. **Cross-Reference Sources**
   - Multiple sources confirm same timeline
   - Conflicting sources require resolution
   - Documentary evidence prioritized over testimony

5. **Test for Plausibility**
   - Could events have occurred in stated sequence?
   - Do travel records, work schedules support timeline?
   - Are gaps or clusters suspicious?

6. **Document Uncertainties**
   - Note where dates are approximate or uncertain
   - Flag contradictions requiring further investigation
   - Distinguish between confirmed and inferred dates

### 9.4 Timeline Visualization Tools

**TimelineJS:**

- Interactive web-based timelines
- Integrates text, images, media
- Google Sheets backend for easy updating
- Embeddable in articles

- Update as new information emerges
- Use for both analysis and publication
- Make interactive versions for readers

### 9.5 Temporal Contradiction Detection

**Pattern Analysis:**

- Cluster events by participant, location, or topic
- Identify gaps in documentation during critical periods
- Look for unusual patterns (e.g., flurry of activity before official decision)
- Compare official timeline to documentary timeline

**Contradiction Types:**

**Type 1: Stated vs. Documented Timeline**

- Official claims event occurred on Date A
- Documents show event occurred on Date B
- Example: "I first learned of this in May" vs. April email showing awareness

**Type 2: Impossible Sequences**

- Event A said to occur after Event B
- Documents show B occurred after A
- Example: Report references data that didn't exist until later date

**Type 3: Backdating**

- Document claimed to be from Date X
- Metadata or content indicates created later
- Example: Meeting minutes reference events that occurred after meeting

**Type 4: Unexplained Gaps**

- Routine documentation suddenly absent
- Resumes after critical period
- Example: Weekly meeting minutes missing for month of controversial decision

**Type 5: Inconsistent Accounts**

- Witness A says event occurred in January
- Witness B says March
- Documents could support either or neither
- Example: Conflicting memories vs. ambiguous documentary evidence

**Investigation Strategies:**

- Confront subjects with timeline contradictions
- Seek explanation for discrepancies
- Obtain additional records to fill gaps
- Expert analysis of document dating
- Correlation with external events (news, travel, etc.)

## 14. Evidence Hierarchy

### 14.1 The Pyramid of Evidence

```
                      ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
                      │  OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS (AUTHENTICATED)│  ← STRONGEST
                      └────────────────────────────────────┘

    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 14.2 Applying the Hierarchy

**Story Construction Principle:**

- **Foundation (Tier 1-3):** Build story on strongest evidence
- **Supporting (Tier 4-5):** Use to supplement and contextualize
- **Cautious Use (Tier 6-7):** Only when essential, with clear attribution and caveats

**Example Application:**

**Claim:** Official X misused public funds for personal benefit

**Tier 1 Evidence (Official Documents):**

- Government procurement records showing contract awarded to Company Y
- Bank records showing payments to Company Y
- Corporate registry showing Official X's spouse as director of Company Y
- **Use:** Foundation of story, can state definitively

**Tier 2 Evidence (Primary Source Documents):**

- Internal company emails discussing project
- Invoices and delivery records
- Contract terms and conditions
- **Use:** Detail the transactions, provide context

**Tier 3 Evidence (Multiple Corroborated Testimonies):**

- Three procurement officers confirm no competitive bidding
- Two company employees say no work was performed
- **Use:** Establish pattern and intent

**Tier 4 Evidence (Single Reliable Testimony + Partial Docs):**

- Whistleblower says Official X ordered contract award, has one email partially supporting this
- **Use:** With attribution, flag as requiring further verification

**Tier 5 Evidence (Circumstantial):**

- Official X vacationed at expensive resort around time of payment
- Official X's standard of living appears inconsistent with salary
- **Use:** Suggestive context, but not proof alone

**Tier 6 Evidence (Single Credible Source):**

- Anonymous government source says Official X is known to be corrupt
- **Use:** If essential, with anonymity explained and strong caveats

**Tier 7 Evidence (Uncorroborated):**

- Random tip that Official X has offshore accounts
- **Use:** Investigative lead, not for publication without verification

**Publication Decision:**

- Strong case based on Tier 1-3 evidence alone
- Tier 4-5 adds context and detail
- Tier 6-7 not necessary for publication, but may guide further investigation

### 14.3 Documentary vs. Testimonial Evidence

**Why Documentary Evidence Is Prioritized:**

**Documentary Evidence Advantages:**

- Contemporaneous (created at time of events)
- Less susceptible to memory errors
- Can be independently verified
- Difficult to dispute if authenticated
- Provides precise details (dates, amounts, exact language)
- Less subject to interpretation

**Testimonial Evidence Limitations:**

- Memory degrades over time
- Susceptible to bias and self-interest
- Can be influenced by subsequent events
- Difficult to verify independently
- Varies based on witness perspective
- Subject to interpretation

**Best Practice:**

- Use documents to establish facts
- Use testimony to explain documents
- Cross-verify testimony against documents
- Flag when testimony contradicts documents
- Seek documents to corroborate testimony
- Prioritize direct witnesses over hearsay

**Example:**

**Strong Approach:**
"The contract was awarded on March 15, 2018, according to procurement records. Three employees involved in the process, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, said the decision was made without competitive bidding. Internal emails obtained by [NewsOrg] show the procurement director writing, 'We need to expedite this for reasons that will become clear,' two days before the award."

**Weak Approach:**
"According to a source, the contract was awarded improperly sometime in early 2018. The source said competitive bidding was skipped and that internal emails would prove this."

## 15. Alignment with S.A.M. Framework

### 15.1 Investigative Journalism and S.A.M. Convergence

The Systematic Adversarial Methodology (S.A.M.) framework aligns closely with investigative journalism best practices, particularly in:

**1. Evidence-Based Analysis**

- **Journalism:** Documentary evidence systematically prioritized over testimonial
- **S.A.M.:** Documents are primary analytical objects, testimony provides context
- **Convergence:** Both frameworks build conclusions on verified documentary foundation

**2. Contradiction Detection**

- **Journalism:** Timeline analysis, cross-referencing sources, identifying inconsistencies
- **S.A.M.:** Eight contradiction types systematically identified and categorized
- **Convergence:** Both actively seek discrepancies rather than accepting surface narratives

**3. Verification Standards**

- **Journalism:** Multi-layered fact-checking, independent verification, source corroboration
- **S.A.M.:** Evidence verification, chain of custody, authentication protocols
- **Convergence:** Both demand rigorous verification before drawing conclusions

**4. Adversarial Approach**

- **Journalism:** Challenge official narratives, test alternative explanations, assume adversarial scrutiny
- **S.A.M.:** Systematic adversarial analysis, question assumptions, expose institutional dysfunction
- **Convergence:** Both adopt skeptical stance toward power and official accounts

**5. Temporal Analysis**

- **Journalism:** Timeline construction, temporal contradiction detection, date verification
- **S.A.M.:** Temporal contradiction type, timeline inconsistencies, date clustering analysis
- **Convergence:** Both recognize temporal analysis as critical for detecting deception

**6. Network Analysis**

- **Journalism:** Map relationships, identify connections, trace financial flows
- **S.A.M.:** Entity extraction, relationship mapping, accountability network analysis
- **Convergence:** Both understand systemic dysfunction requires relationship analysis

**7. Transparency and Methodology**

- **Journalism:** Document process, explain methodology, transparent about limitations
- **S.A.M.:** Methodology documentation, audit trails, reproducible analysis
- **Convergence:** Both value transparency as essential for credibility

**8. Public Interest Focus**

- **Journalism:** Public interest justification for all investigations
- **S.A.M.:** Focus on institutional dysfunction affecting public welfare
- **Convergence:** Both exist to serve public accountability, not private interests

### 15.2 S.A.M. Contradiction Types in Journalistic Context

**SELF Contradictions:**

- **Journalistic Application:** Single document contains internally inconsistent information
- **Example:** Official report states "no prior knowledge" in executive summary but timeline shows earlier awareness
- **Detection Method:** Close reading, timeline construction, fact-checking

**INTER_DOC Contradictions:**

- **Journalistic Application:** Documents from same source contradict each other
- **Example:** Public statement denies involvement, internal memo shows active participation
- **Detection Method:** Cross-referencing, document comparison, systematic search

**TEMPORAL Contradictions:**

- **Journalistic Application:** Timeline inconsistencies, impossible sequences, backdating
- **Example:** Meeting minutes reference data that didn't exist until later date
- **Detection Method:** Timeline construction, date verification, metadata analysis

**EVIDENTIARY Contradictions:**

- **Journalistic Application:** Claims unsupported by presented evidence
- **Example:** Report claims "thorough investigation" but no investigation records exist
- **Detection Method:** Evidence inventory, verification against claims, document analysis

**MODALITY_SHIFT:**

- **Journalistic Application:** Changes in certainty or tone without explanation
- **Example:** "Definitely no wrongdoing" becomes "no evidence of intentional wrongdoing"
- **Detection Method:** Language analysis, compare versions, timeline of statements

**SELECTIVE_CITATION:**

- **Journalistic Application:** Cherry-picking evidence, ignoring contradictory information
- **Example:** Official report cites three supportive studies, ignores ten contrary studies
- **Detection Method:** Literature review, expert consultation, comprehensive document search

**SCOPE_SHIFT:**

- **Journalistic Application:** Unexplained changes in investigation or report scope
- **Example:** Investigation initially covers five departments, final report only addresses one
- **Detection Method:** Compare initial scope to final product, document exclusions

**UNEXPLAINED_CHANGE:**

- **Journalistic Application:** Position or policy changes without justification
- **Example:** "Contractor met all requirements" becomes "contractor terminated for cause"
- **Detection Method:** Timeline of statements, seek explanation, interview key actors

### 15.3 Integrating S.A.M. into Investigative Workflow

**Document Ingestion Phase:**

- Apply S.A.M. 7-stage pipeline for large document sets
- Entity extraction for network analysis
- Temporal extraction for timeline construction
- Metadata preservation for authenticity verification

**Analysis Phase:**

- Systematically search for S.A.M. contradiction types
- Use S.A.M. framework to organize findings
- Cross-reference contradictions with evidence hierarchy
- Map accountability networks

**Verification Phase:**

- Apply journalism verification standards to S.A.M. findings
- Corroborate contradictions with multiple sources
- Test alternative explanations for contradictions
- Document verification process

**Publication Phase:**

- Present contradictions with full context
- Cite specific evidence for each contradiction
- Explain significance and patterns
- Transparent about methodology and limitations

### 15.4 S.A.M. as Tool for Investigative Journalism

**Advantages:**

- Systematic framework prevents missing contradictions
- Categorization helps organize complex investigations
- Aligns with journalistic emphasis on documentary evidence
- Network analysis reveals systemic issues
- Temporal analysis built-in
- Scalable to large document sets

**Considerations:**

- S.A.M. is analytical tool, not substitute for journalistic judgment
- Context and nuance require human interpretation
- Ethical and legal review still essential
- Source protection paramount regardless of methodology
- Public interest assessment guides S.A.M. application

**Best Practice Integration:**

- Use S.A.M. for systematic analysis of large document sets
- Apply journalistic verification to S.A.M. findings
- Combine S.A.M. entity/network analysis with source interviews
- Integrate S.A.M. timelines with traditional timeline construction
- Document S.A.M. methodology for transparency
- Report S.A.M. findings in accessible narrative form

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Glossary of Terms

**Adversarial Analysis:** Systematic approach to evidence evaluation that assumes critical scrutiny and actively seeks disconfirming evidence.

**Attribution:** The act of identifying the source of information in reporting. Levels include on-record (full identification), on-background (information usable, not directly attributed), on-deep-background (guides reporting, not cited), and off-record (not usable in publication).

**Chain of Custody:** Documentation of the possession, handling, and transfer of evidence from acquisition through publication, ensuring integrity and authenticity.

**Contradiction:** Inconsistency between two or more pieces of evidence, testimony, or claims that requires investigation and resolution.

**Corroboration:** Confirmation of information through multiple independent sources or types of evidence.

**Disambiguation:** Process of determining which real-world entity a name or reference refers to when multiple possibilities exist.

**Documentary Evidence:** Written or recorded evidence, including official documents, contracts, emails, financial records, etc. Generally more reliable than testimonial evidence.

**Embargo:** Agreement not to publish information until a specified date/time, often used in collaborative investigations to coordinate release.

**Entity Extraction (NER):** Automated identification of named entities (people, organizations, locations, etc.) in text documents.

**Fact-Checking:** Independent verification of factual claims in reporting, ideally by someone not involved in the original reporting.

**FOIA (Freedom of Information Act):** Laws requiring government agencies to disclose records upon request (terminology varies by country).

**Hypothesis-Driven Investigation:** Investigative approach that begins with a clear hypothesis, distinguishes facts from assumptions, and tests the hypothesis against evidence.

**I-Hub:** ICIJ's custom collaboration platform for global investigative teams.

**Named Entity Recognition (NER):** See Entity Extraction.

**Network Analysis:** Mapping and analyzing relationships between entities (people, organizations) to reveal connections and patterns.

**OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Technology to extract text from scanned documents or images.

**OSINT (Open Source Intelligence):** Intelligence gathering from publicly available sources.

**Provenance:** The origin and history of a document or piece of evidence, including how it was created, who had access, and how it reached the journalist.

**Redaction:** Removal or obscuring of sensitive information (PII, source-identifying details, national security info, etc.) from documents before publication.

**Right of Reply:** Journalistic practice of giving subjects of investigations opportunity to respond to allegations before publication.

**SecureDrop:** Open-source whistleblower submission system enabling anonymous document leaks to journalists.

**Source Protection:** Measures taken to prevent identification of confidential sources, including legal, technical, and operational security measures.

**Temporal Analysis:** Examination of when events occurred, timeline construction, and identification of temporal contradictions.

**Testimonial Evidence:** Evidence derived from witness statements or interviews. Generally less reliable than documentary evidence and requires corroboration.

**Verification:** Process of confirming the accuracy and authenticity of information, documents, or sources through independent methods.

**Whistleblower:** Individual who exposes wrongdoing within an organization, often providing insider information or documents to journalists or authorities.
