# Framing Analysis - How Selective Presentation Shapes Understanding

**Document Classification:** Communication Theory and Methodology
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-01-18
**Purpose:** Provide theoretical foundation for media framing analysis with practical application to documentary and institutional communication analysis

---

## Executive Summary

Framing is the process by which communicators select, organize, and emphasize certain aspects of reality while minimizing or excluding others. This selective presentation fundamentally shapes how audiences perceive events, attribute causation, and form judgments. Understanding framing is essential for forensic analysis of media content, institutional communications, and documentary journalism.

**Key Principles:**

- Frames operate through selection and salience, not through explicit argumentation
- What is omitted is often as significant as what is included
- Framing effects are measurable through systematic content analysis
- Documentary framing carries particular ethical obligations due to truth claims
- The S.A.M. methodology provides structured detection of framing bias

**Core Finding:** Framing analysis reveals how ostensibly neutral presentations encode particular interpretations, attribute responsibility, and constrain audience understanding. Quantitative measurement of framing ratios, omission patterns, and narrative structure enables systematic detection of bias that qualitative assessment alone would miss.

## 1. Introduction: What Is Framing and Why It Matters

Every act of communication involves choices. When a journalist, documentary filmmaker, or institutional communicator presents information, they must decide what to include, what to exclude, how to sequence information, what terminology to use, and which voices to privilege. These choices constitute **framing**--the process of selecting and highlighting certain facets of events or issues to promote a particular interpretation.

Framing matters because it operates below the threshold of explicit argument. A news report does not need to assert "this person is guilty" to create that impression; the selection of images, the emphasis on certain facts, the voices given prominence, and the narrative structure all work to construct an interpretation without making it explicit. This implicit operation makes framing both powerful and difficult to detect without systematic analysis.

**Example: Terminology Effects**

Consider how labeling shapes perception:

| Term | Connotation | Effect on Audience |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Suspect** | Active investigation, potential guilt | Implies criminality, justifies scrutiny |
| **Person of Interest** | Under consideration, undefined status | Suggests relevance without overt accusation |
| **Individual questioned** | Procedural description only | Neutral, implies routine process |
| **Innocent person** | Cleared, no wrongdoing | Emphasizes absence of guilt |
| **Alleged perpetrator** | Legal caution with guilt implication | Hedge that preserves accusatory frame |

A documentary that consistently refers to someone as a "suspect" throughout its runtime creates a fundamentally different impression than one using "the man police questioned"--even when presenting identical factual content. The frame precedes and shapes the interpretation of the facts.

**Practical Stakes**

Framing analysis is not merely academic. In legal contexts, prejudicial framing can affect fair trial rights. In regulatory matters, framing determines whether conduct appears reasonable or culpable. In public discourse, frames shape policy preferences and political attitudes. For individuals subjected to media coverage, framing can constitute reputational damage regardless of underlying facts.

## 2. Framing Theory: Goffman, Entman, and Selective Salience

### 2.1 Goffman's Frame Analysis

Sociologist Erving Goffman introduced frame analysis in his 1974 work, defining frames as "schemata of interpretation" that enable individuals to "locate, perceive, identify, and label" occurrences within their life space and the world at large. For Goffman, frames are cognitive structures that organize experience and guide action.

**Primary Frameworks:**

- **Natural frameworks:** Identify occurrences as undirected, unguided, purely physical events
- **Social frameworks:** Provide background understanding of events involving will, aim, and controlling effort

Goffman's insight was that the same event can be framed in radically different ways, each producing a coherent but distinct understanding. A fire can be framed as a natural disaster (uncontrollable, requiring sympathy) or as negligence (controllable, requiring accountability). The frame applied determines the response deemed appropriate.

### 2.2 Entman's Framing Paradigm

Robert Entman operationalized framing for media analysis, defining it as the process of selecting "some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation."

**Entman's Four Framing Functions:**

1. **Problem Definition:** What issue is being presented? How is the situation characterized?
2. **Causal Attribution:** What or who is identified as causing the problem?
3. **Moral Evaluation:** What moral judgments are invited about actors and actions?
4. **Treatment Recommendation:** What solutions or responses are suggested?

**Application Example:**

Consider coverage of a police shooting:

| Function | Frame A: "Officer-Involved Shooting" | Frame B: "Police Kill Unarmed Man" |
|----------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Problem Definition | Dangerous situation requiring force | Excessive force by police |
| Causal Attribution | Subject's behavior necessitated response | Officer's decision to use lethal force |
| Moral Evaluation | Officer faced difficult choice | Officer acted improperly |
| Treatment Recommendation | Support for police training | Accountability and reform |

Both frames can present identical facts while producing opposite interpretations.

### 2.3 Selective Salience

Salience refers to "making a piece of information more noticeable, meaningful, or memorable to audiences." Framing operates through salience by:

- **Placement:** Front-page vs. back-section; opening segment vs. closing footnote
- **Repetition:** How often claims, images, or characterizations appear
- **Association:** What concepts, images, or individuals are linked together
- **Sourcing:** Whose voices are given prominence and credibility
- **Visualization:** What images accompany the narrative

A claim repeated twelve times with expert endorsement achieves different salience than a claim mentioned once by a contested source--even if both are technically "included" in the coverage.

---

## 3. Selection and Omission: What's Included vs. Excluded

Framing operates as much through omission as through inclusion. What is left out of a narrative often reveals more about the frame than what is included.

### 3.1 The Mechanics of Omission

**Structural Omissions:**

- Entire categories of evidence excluded (e.g., exculpatory findings)
- Key time periods absent from chronology
- Relevant actors not mentioned or interviewed
- Alternative interpretations not acknowledged

**Contextual Omissions:**

- Background that would change interpretation
- Qualifying information that moderates claims
- Contradicting evidence from same sources
- Subsequent developments that alter meaning

**Procedural Omissions:**

- Methodology not disclosed
- Source limitations not acknowledged
- Conflicting expert opinions not mentioned
- Legal status and outcomes omitted

### 3.2 Measuring Omission Patterns

Omission analysis requires comparing the communication product against the available source material. Key metrics include:

**Directional Bias Calculation:**

```
Directional Bias = (Omissions favoring Position A - Omissions favoring Position B) / Total Significant Omissions

Score of +1.0 = 100% of omissions favor one position
Score of 0.0 = Balanced omission pattern
Score of -1.0 = 100% of omissions favor opposite position
```

**Omission Categories:**

1. **Exculpatory Omissions:** Evidence that would favor the subject is excluded
2. **Contextual Omissions:** Background that would change interpretation is missing
3. **Procedural Omissions:** Process information that affects credibility is absent
4. **Temporal Omissions:** Timeline information that alters meaning is excluded
5. **Contradicting Omissions:** Evidence that conflicts with the narrative is left out

**Example Analysis:**

In a documentary about a criminal investigation, analysis might reveal:

- 8 significant omissions identified
- All 8 omissions favor prosecution narrative
- 0 omissions favor defense narrative
- Directional Bias Score: +1.0 (maximum prosecution-favoring)

This pattern indicates systematic selection rather than random editorial choice.

## 4. Narrative Construction: How Stories Shape Interpretation

Narratives are not neutral containers for facts; they are interpretive structures that organize information into causal sequences with protagonists, antagonists, conflicts, and resolutions.

### 4.1 Narrative Elements as Framing Devices

**Character Assignment:**

- Who is presented as protagonist (sympathetic, relatable)?
- Who is cast as antagonist (threatening, culpable)?
- Who are secondary characters (supporting, contextual)?
- Who is absent from the narrative entirely?

**Temporal Ordering:**

- What is the starting point of the narrative? (Origin frames causation)
- What is the endpoint? (Conclusion frames resolution)
- What events are detailed vs. summarized?
- What gaps exist in the timeline?

**Causal Linkage:**

- What events are connected as cause and effect?
- What alternative causes are acknowledged or excluded?
- How is responsibility attributed across actors?

### 4.2 Story Templates and Genre Expectations

Media coverage often follows recognizable templates that carry interpretive baggage:

**Crime Drama Template:**

- Clear villain/suspect
- Investigation revealing truth
- Resolution through justice system
- Audience positioned as jury

**Tragedy Template:**

- Sympathetic victim
- Inexplicable loss
- Community response
- Search for meaning

**Exposé Template:**

- Hidden wrongdoing
- Courageous revelation
- Institutional failure
- Call for accountability

The template selected constrains interpretation. A crime drama template applied to an ambiguous situation imposes guilt/innocence framing even when facts support neither.

### 4.3 Narrative Privilege and Voice

**Source Hierarchy:**

1. Who speaks in their own voice (direct quotes, interviews)?
2. Who is paraphrased by others?
3. Who is described but not heard from?
4. Who is absent entirely?

**Credibility Markers:**

- Professional titles and institutional affiliations
- Visual presentation (settings, attire, demeanor)
- Introduction and contextualization
- Juxtaposition with other speakers

A subject introduced as "the accused" and interviewed in harsh lighting carries different credibility than one introduced as "the father" in a home setting--regardless of identical statements.

## 5. Quantitative Framing Analysis: Measuring Bias Through Content Analysis

Systematic content analysis transforms subjective impressions into measurable indicators.

### 5.1 Key Metrics

**Framing Ratio:**

```
Framing Ratio = Time/Space devoted to Perspective A : Time/Space devoted to Perspective B

Example: 13.2:1 ratio indicates 13.2 units of coverage for one perspective per 1 unit for the alternative
```

**Statistical Significance:**

Large framing ratios require statistical evaluation to assess whether they could arise by chance.

- **Z-score:** Standard deviation from expected balanced distribution
- **P-value:** Probability of observing such imbalance under null hypothesis of balance
- **Confidence Interval:** Range within which true ratio likely falls

**Example:**

A documentary with 92 minutes devoted to prosecution narrative and 7 minutes to defense produces:
- Framing Ratio: 13.2:1
- Z-score: 4.67
- P-value: < 0.00001

This indicates statistically significant imbalance beyond any reasonable attribution to editorial judgment or time constraints.

### 5.2 Content Analysis Protocol

**Systematic Coding:**

1. **Unit Definition:** Identify coding units (segments, statements, time blocks)
2. **Category Development:** Create exhaustive, mutually exclusive categories
3. **Coding Rules:** Establish clear criteria for category assignment
4. **Inter-Rater Reliability:** Multiple coders to verify consistency
5. **Statistical Analysis:** Calculate frequencies, ratios, significance tests

**Reliability Standards:**

- Cohen's Kappa ≥ 0.60 for "substantial agreement"
- Krippendorff's Alpha ≥ 0.667 for minimum reliability
- Percentage agreement insufficient alone (inflated by chance)

### 5.3 Identifying Patterns

**Indicator Clusters:**

- Consistent directional omissions suggest systematic bias
- Repeated terminology patterns indicate intentional framing
- Source selection patterns reveal perspective privileging
- Timing and placement patterns show salience manipulation

## 6. Documentary Framing: Specific Issues in Documentary Journalism

Documentary formats present distinct framing challenges due to their truth claims, extended runtime, and editorial control.

### 6.1 The Documentary Truth Claim

Unlike acknowledged fiction, documentaries make implicit or explicit claims to represent reality. This truth claim creates ethical obligations regarding:

- **Accuracy:** Factual assertions must be verifiable
- **Fairness:** Subjects must be treated equitably
- **Context:** Information must be presented with relevant background
- **Consent:** Subjects' participation must be informed and voluntary

When documentaries violate these obligations, the truth claim transforms framing into misrepresentation.

### 6.2 Editorial Control and Power Asymmetry

Documentary subjects typically surrender editorial control to filmmakers. This asymmetry creates vulnerability:

- **Selection of footage:** Filmmakers choose from hours of material
- **Sequencing:** Order creates meaning beyond content
- **Juxtaposition:** Placement next to other material creates association
- **Narration:** Voice-over interprets footage for audience
- **Music and editing:** Emotional cues shape response

Subjects cannot control how their participation is used, making consent to participation distinct from consent to portrayal.

### 6.3 Regulatory Framework

Documentary broadcasting is subject to regulatory standards that address framing:

**Ofcom Broadcasting Code (UK):**

- **Section 5:** Due impartiality in matters of political or industrial controversy
- **Section 7:** Privacy protections for individuals
- **Section 8:** Fairness in portrayal of individuals and organizations

**Key Principles:**

- Facts must be presented accurately
- Material omissions must not mislead
- Individuals treated unfairly must have opportunity to respond
- Privacy intrusion requires justification in public interest

Framing analysis provides evidence for regulatory complaints by quantifying imbalance, documenting omissions, and demonstrating material unfairness.

### 6.4 Common Documentary Framing Issues

**Narrative Predetermination:**

Documentary commissioned or developed with predetermined narrative seeks evidence to support conclusion rather than following evidence to conclusion.

**Selective Editing:**

Hours of footage reduced to minutes inevitably involves selection; question is whether selection serves accuracy or narrative convenience.

**Contextual Manipulation:**

Statements accurate in isolation but misleading without context (e.g., responses to questions not shown, partial quotes, outdated statements presented as current).

**Visual Framing:**

Camera angles, lighting, setting selection, b-roll imagery all communicate beyond verbal content.

**Omission of Exculpatory Information:**

Failure to include information that would fundamentally alter interpretation, particularly when such information was available to filmmakers.

## 7. Connection to Phronesis Documentary Analysis Capabilities

The Phronesis platform implements systematic framing analysis through the S.A.M. (Systematic Adversarial Methodology) framework and specialized engines.

### 7.1 S.A.M. Methodology for Framing Detection

The four-phase cascade analysis reveals how frames develop and propagate:

1. **ANCHOR:** Identify the original framing choice--where did the characterization originate?
2. **INHERIT:** Track how subsequent coverage adopted the frame without independent verification
3. **COMPOUND:** Document how repetition accumulated authority for the frame
4. **ARRIVE:** Map how the frame produced consequences (reputational, legal, institutional)

### 7.2 Eight Contradiction Types Applied to Framing

S.A.M. contradiction detection reveals framing inconsistencies:

| Type | Framing Application |
|------|---------------------|
| **SELF** | Internal contradictions within documentary narrative |
| **INTER_DOC** | Conflicts between documentary claims and source documents |
| **TEMPORAL** | Timeline manipulations that alter meaning |
| **EVIDENTIARY** | Claims unsupported by evidence presented |
| **MODALITY_SHIFT** | Certainty changes without justification (allegation becomes fact) |
| **SELECTIVE_CITATION** | Cherry-picking from sources |
| **SCOPE_SHIFT** | Unexplained changes in what is being claimed |
| **UNEXPLAINED_CHANGE** | Narrative shifts without acknowledgment |

### 7.3 Documentary Analysis Engine

The Phronesis Documentary Analysis Engine (symbol: Delta) provides:

**Source-to-Broadcast Comparison:**

- Systematic comparison of documentary content against available sources
- Identification of omissions, additions, and transformations
- Measurement of framing ratios and directional bias

## Conclusion

Framing analysis provides the theoretical foundation and practical methodology for understanding how selective presentation shapes interpretation. By systematically analyzing what is included, what is excluded, how information is organized, and what perspectives are privileged, forensic analysts can reveal the interpretive work embedded in ostensibly neutral communications.

The integration of framing theory with quantitative content analysis transforms subjective impressions into measurable evidence. This evidence supports regulatory complaints, civil claims, and public accountability for media that fails to meet professional standards.

Phronesis implements these principles through the S.A.M. methodology and specialized engines, providing systematic tools for detecting framing bias in documentary journalism, institutional communications, and media coverage. The goal is not neutral coverage--an impossibility--but transparent, fair, and accurate coverage that acknowledges its limitations and gives subjects equitable treatment.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. Framing operates through selection and salience, not explicit argument
2. Omission patterns reveal systematic bias more clearly than inclusion patterns
3. Quantitative metrics (framing ratios, directional bias scores) provide objective evidence
4. Documentary journalism carries heightened obligations due to truth claims
5. The S.A.M. methodology provides structured detection of framing bias
6. Integration with regulatory frameworks enables accountability
