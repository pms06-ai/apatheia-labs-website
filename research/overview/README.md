# Apatheia Labs Research Hub

Comprehensive research repository supporting the development of Phronesis FCIP and forensic intelligence methodologies. This hub organizes research across multiple disciplines to inform systematic analysis, evidence-based investigation, and institutional accountability frameworks.

## Philosophy

"Clarity Without Distortion" requires deep understanding of how knowledge is constructed, validated, and distorted across domains. This research hub maintains a living collection of frameworks, methodologies, and empirical findings that:

- Ground platform design in established professional practice
- Inform analysis engine development with domain expertise
- Provide theoretical foundations for systematic methodology
- Document empirical evidence for cognitive biases and institutional failures
- Enable interdisciplinary synthesis and pattern recognition
