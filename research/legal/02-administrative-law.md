# Administrative Law and Agency Action

## Abstract

Administrative law governs the exercise of public power, providing legal frameworks to scrutinise decisions by government bodies, regulators, and public authorities. In the UK, judicial review has evolved through common law development and statutory intervention to establish grounds for challenging administrative action: illegality, irrationality, and procedural impropriety. This article examines the doctrinal foundations of UK administrative law, analysing key principles including natural justice, legitimate expectations, Wednesbury unreasonableness, and the duty to give reasons. Particular attention is paid to how these principles apply to regulatory decision-making and institutional accountability, with implications for systematically identifying and challenging unlawful agency action.

## Introduction

Administrative law operates at the intersection of executive power and individual rights. Wade and Forsyth (2014) describe it as "the law relating to the control of governmental power," encompassing the mechanisms by which courts supervise the activities of administrative agencies, local authorities, tribunals, and other public bodies. Unlike private law disputes between parties of equal standing, administrative law addresses the fundamental asymmetry between state institutions and those subject to their decisions.

The UK's unwritten constitutional framework creates particular challenges for administrative law. Without a codified separation of powers or entrenched fundamental rights (prior to the Human Rights Act 1998), courts have developed common law principles to constrain executive action. These principles serve dual functions: ensuring agencies act within statutory authority whilst protecting procedural fairness and substantive rationality in decision-making.

For institutional accountability analysis, administrative law provides the doctrinal foundation for identifying when agencies exceed their powers, act irrationally, or breach procedural requirements. Understanding these principles enables systematic evaluation of whether institutional decisions are legally defensible or vulnerable to challenge.

## The Three Grounds of Judicial Review

Lord Diplock's taxonomy in *Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service* [1985] AC 374 (the GCHQ case) established three grounds for judicial review that have structured administrative law analysis for four decades: illegality, irrationality, and procedural impropriety. This tripartite framework, whilst subsequently refined and expanded, remains the foundational architecture for challenging administrative action.

### Illegality

Illegality addresses whether a decision-maker has correctly understood and applied the law governing their powers. Craig (2016) identifies several manifestations of illegality:

**Ultra vires**: An authority acts ultra vires when it exceeds the powers conferred by statute. The doctrine rests on parliamentary sovereignty—agencies derive authority from legislation and cannot lawfully act beyond statutory limits. In *Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission* [1969] 2 AC 147, the House of Lords established that jurisdictional errors render decisions nullities, not merely voidable.

**Error of law**: Even when acting within jurisdiction, agencies commit illegality by misinterpreting the legal framework. *R v Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page* [1993] AC 682 distinguished between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors, though this boundary has become increasingly porous. The modern approach treats most errors of law as reviewable, reflecting courts' constitutional role as ultimate interpreters of law (Elliott & Thomas, 2017).

**Irrelevant considerations and improper purposes**: Section 1 of Wednesbury principles (see below) requires decision-makers to consider relevant factors and disregard irrelevant ones. *R v Somerset County Council, ex parte Fewings* [1995] 1 WLR 1037 illustrates improper purpose: the council's decision to ban deer hunting on its land was quashed because it relied on moral objections rather than statutory land management criteria.

**Fettering of discretion**: When Parliament confers discretionary power, agencies must exercise genuine judgment in each case rather than applying rigid policies. *British Oxygen Co Ltd v Minister of Technology* [1971] AC 610 established that policies are permissible for consistency, but agencies must remain willing to consider exceptional circumstances. This principle prevents agencies from effectively rewriting their statutory mandates through inflexible policy application.

### Irrationality (Wednesbury Unreasonableness)

The second ground addresses substantive review of decision-making rationality. *Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation* [1948] 1 KB 223 established that decisions may be quashed if "so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it." Lord Greene MR's formulation creates a high threshold—courts intervene only when decisions are so outrageous in defiance of logic or accepted moral standards that no sensible person applying themselves to the question could arrive at them.

The Wednesbury standard serves constitutional functions by respecting agency expertise and democratic accountability whilst preventing egregious irrationality. Craig (2016) identifies the delicate balance: courts must avoid substituting their judgment for agencies' whilst maintaining meaningful review of substantive outcomes.

Subsequent developments have refined Wednesbury review:

**Balancing relevant factors**: Beyond considering only relevant factors, agencies must weigh them appropriately. *R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind* [1991] 1 AC 696 established that disproportionate weight given to one factor can render decisions unreasonable.

**Evidential basis**: Decisions lacking an adequate evidential foundation may be irrational. *R (Khatun) v Newham London Borough Council* [2005] QB 37 emphasised that rationality requires decisions to be supported by evidence that justifies the conclusion reached.

**Consistency**: Unexplained departures from established practice may indicate irrationality, particularly where individuals have relied on consistent decision-making patterns (Elliott, 2014).

### Procedural Impropriety

The third ground encompasses both breach of statutory procedures and violation of common law natural justice principles. Lord Diplock in GCHQ described procedural impropriety as including "failure to observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with procedural fairness towards the person who will be affected by the decision."

This ground recognises that procedure and substance are inseparable—fair processes promote accurate outcomes whilst protecting individual dignity in state interactions.

## Natural Justice and Procedural Fairness

Natural justice comprises two fundamental principles derived from Roman law: *audi alteram partem* (hear the other side) and *nemo judex in causa sua* (no one should be judge in their own cause). These maxims form the procedural foundation of administrative law, applicable even absent express statutory provision.

### The Right to a Fair Hearing (Audi Alteram Partem)

The principle that affected individuals must be heard before adverse decisions has ancient common law roots. *Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works* (1863) 14 CB (NS) 180 established that even without statutory specification, principles of natural justice require notice and opportunity to be heard before property rights are affected.

The content of fair hearing rights varies contextually. *Ridge v Baldwin* [1964] AC 40 rejected the distinction between judicial, quasi-judicial, and administrative functions, extending natural justice requirements across administrative decision-making. Lord Reid emphasised that whenever statutory power affects individuals' rights or interests, some form of fair hearing is required unless clearly excluded by statute.

Modern case law establishes flexible fair hearing requirements calibrated to context:

**Notice**: Affected persons must receive adequate notice of proposed decisions, including the case they must meet. *R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody* [1994] 1 AC 531 required parole decision-makers to disclose material considered in reaching decisions.

**Opportunity to respond**: Individuals must have genuine opportunity to present their case, though oral hearings are not always required. Written representations may suffice depending on issues' nature and potential consequences (*Lloyd v McMahon* [1987] AC 625).

**Disclosure**: Decision-makers must generally disclose material upon which they rely, enabling effective responses. *R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Fayed* [1998] 1 WLR 763 recognised exceptions for national security but emphasised that fairness requires maximum practicable disclosure.

**Reasons**: The duty to give reasons (discussed below) has evolved from discretionary practice to increasingly mandatory requirement, particularly where liberty or significant rights are affected.

### The Rule Against Bias (Nemo Judex in Causa sua)

Bias encompasses actual bias (subjective partiality) and apparent bias (objective appearance of partiality). The modern test, established in *Porter v Magill* [2002] 2 AC 357, asks whether "the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased."

This objective test replaced earlier formulations' "real danger" or "reasonable suspicion" standards, aligning UK law with the European Court of Human Rights' approach whilst maintaining common law foundations (Elliott & Thomas, 2017).

Apparent bias arises from various circumstances:

**Direct interest**: Pecuniary or proprietary interest in outcome renders decision-makers automatically disqualified without investigating actual bias (*Dimes v Grand Junction Canal Proprietors* (1852) 3 HL Cas 759).

**Indirect interest**: Non-pecuniary interests, including personal relationships or professional associations, may create disqualifying bias depending on circumstances (*R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No 2)* [2000] 1 AC 119).

**Pre-determination**: Decision-makers must approach decisions with open minds. *R (Lewis) v Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council* [2010] UKSC 11 distinguished permissible predisposition from impermissible predetermination—councillors may hold views on policy issues but must remain open to persuasion on specific applications.

**Institutional bias**: Structural arrangements where decision-makers have organisational interests in outcomes can create apparent bias, particularly where agencies act as "prosecutor and judge" in enforcement matters (Wade & Forsyth, 2014).

## Legitimate Expectations

The doctrine of legitimate expectations extends natural justice by protecting procedural and sometimes substantive expectations created by agency representations or established practices. This principle, whilst rooted in procedural fairness, has evolved to constrain the substantive exercise of discretionary power.

### Procedural Legitimate Expectations

The GCHQ case established that legitimate expectations can found procedural protection: where agencies have created expectations of consultation before changing policy, fairness requires honouring those expectations absent overriding public interest. Lord Fraser stated that individuals "may have a legitimate expectation of being consulted or heard before a decision is taken which affects them."

*R v North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan* [2001] QB 213 refined the doctrine's scope, identifying three categories of case:

1. Expectations that agencies will follow their own policies, enforceable via traditional Wednesbury review
2. Procedural expectations requiring hearing or consultation
3. Substantive expectations where representation or practice creates entitlement to specific substantive outcomes

### Substantive Legitimate Expectations

The third Coughlan category remains controversial. Courts have recognised that particularly clear and unambiguous representations may create expectations protecting substantive outcomes, not merely procedures (*R (Bibi) v Newham London Borough Council* [2002] 1 WLR 237). However, substantive legitimate expectations cannot prevent agencies from changing policy to meet changed circumstances or new priorities (Elliott, 2014).

The test asks whether frustrating legitimate expectations is so unfair as to amount to an abuse of power. This requires weighing:

- Clarity and specificity of representation
- Reliance placed on representation
- Detrimental consequences of frustrating expectation
- Public interest in resiling from representation

Craig (2016) observes that substantive legitimate expectations effectively impose consistency requirements on discretionary powers, constraining agencies' ability to depart from established patterns without adequate justification.

### Limits on Legitimate Expectations

Legitimate expectations cannot create rights contradicting statutory frameworks. *R v Secretary of State for Education and Employment, ex parte Begbie* [2000] 1 WLR 1115 emphasised that agencies cannot be estopped from performing statutory duties, and representations beyond agencies' powers cannot found legitimate expectations.

The doctrine thus operates within, not against, the statutory framework—protecting reasonable expectations without undermining parliamentary sovereignty.

## Proportionality

Proportionality represents the most significant evolution in UK administrative law, driven by European Union law and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Whilst distinct from traditional Wednesbury review, proportionality has not displaced common law grounds but rather supplements them in specific contexts.

### Proportionality under the Human Rights Act

Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires public authorities to act compatibly with Convention rights. When fundamental rights are engaged, courts apply proportionality rather than Wednesbury rationality. *R (Daly) v Secretary of State for the Home Department* [2001] UKHL 26 established proportionality's four-stage test:

1. Does the measure have a legitimate aim?
2. Is it rationally connected to that aim?
3. Could a less intrusive measure achieve the aim?
4. Does the measure strike a fair balance between individual rights and public interest?

Lord Steyn in *Daly* noted proportionality's "more intense review" compared to Wednesbury, requiring attention to the relative weight assigned to interests and considerations. This represents a qualitative shift from procedural rationality review towards substantive balancing of competing interests.

### EU Law Influence

During EU membership, proportionality governed review of measures implementing or affected by EU law. *R v Chief Constable of Sussex, ex parte International Trader's Ferry Ltd* [1999] 2 AC 418 applied proportionality to policing decisions affecting free movement rights.

Post-Brexit, proportionality's scope has contracted to cases engaging retained EU law or Convention rights, though its broader influence on judicial review methodology persists (Elliott & Thomas, 2020).

### Relationship with Wednesbury

Debate continues over whether proportionality should replace Wednesbury as the general rationality standard. Proponents argue proportionality provides more structured and transparent review (Jowell, 2015). Critics warn it risks judicial overreach by substituting courts' balancing for agencies' judgment on policy matters (Allan, 2016).

The current position maintains parallel tracks: Wednesbury for traditional administrative decisions, proportionality where fundamental rights are engaged. *Pham v Secretary of State for the Home Department* [2015] UKSC 19 left open whether common law itself requires proportionality analysis in certain contexts, suggesting potential future convergence.

## The Duty to Give Reasons

The duty to give reasons has evolved from discretionary practice to increasingly mandatory requirement, reflecting recognition that reasons serve multiple functions: enabling effective appeals, demonstrating decision-makers addressed relevant issues, and promoting careful deliberation.

### Common Law Development

Historically, common law imposed no general duty to give reasons. *R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody* [1994] 1 AC 531 marked a watershed, requiring parole decision-makers to provide reasons for departing from judicial recommendations. Lord Mustill identified reasons' importance for ensuring fairness and enabling effective judicial review.

*R v Higher Education Funding Council, ex parte Institute of Dental Surgery* [1994] 1 WLR 242 established that whilst no universal common law duty exists, reasons are required where:

- Interests at stake are significant
- Decision appears aberrant on its face
- Subject matter involves human rights or fundamental freedoms
- Reasons are necessary for effective appeal

### Statutory Duties

Many statutory schemes now mandate reasons. Section 10 of the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1992 requires tribunals to provide reasons if requested. Sector-specific legislation frequently imposes reasons requirements, particularly in areas affecting liberty, property, or livelihood.

### Content Requirements

Reasons must be adequate and intelligible, addressing principal controversial issues and explaining the decision reached. *South Bucks District Council v Porter (No 2)* [2004] UKHL 33 established that whilst reasons need not be elaborate, they must enable readers to understand why decisions were made and whether legal errors occurred.

Inadequate reasons may render decisions irrational or procedurally improper, providing independent grounds for judicial review (*R (Wooder) v Feggetter* [2003] QB 219).

## Application to Regulatory Decision-Making

Administrative law principles apply directly to regulatory agencies' enforcement, licensing, and adjudicative functions. Understanding these principles is essential for identifying challengeable defects in institutional decision-making.

### Regulatory Discretion and Its Limits

Regulatory statutes typically confer broad discretionary powers to achieve policy objectives. However, discretion operates within legal boundaries established by administrative law principles:

**Statutory purpose**: Regulators must exercise powers for purposes Parliament intended. *Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food* [1968] AC 997 established that discretion must be used to promote statutory objectives, not frustrate them.

**Relevant considerations**: Regulatory decisions must consider all relevant factors mandated by statute or inherent in the decision's subject matter whilst excluding irrelevant considerations. In broadcasting regulation, for example, Ofcom must consider statutory duties regarding impartiality, privacy, and fairness—decisions ignoring these factors are illegal.

**Consistency**: Regulatory agencies must apply policies consistently unless differences in individual cases justify departure. Unexplained inconsistent treatment may indicate irrationality or improper consideration of irrelevant factors.

### Procedural Fairness in Enforcement

Natural justice applies with particular force to enforcement proceedings where regulators act as investigators, prosecutors, and initial adjudicators. This concentration of functions creates potential for actual or apparent bias requiring procedural safeguards:

**Separation of functions**: Whilst structural separation is not always required, agencies must ensure investigative and adjudicative functions are sufficiently separated to avoid apparent bias (*R v Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Kirkstall Valley Campaign Ltd* [1996] 3 All ER 304).

**Notice of allegations**: Regulated entities must receive clear notice of charges or allegations, enabling effective response. Vague or shifting allegations violate fair hearing requirements.

**Access to evidence**: Fairness generally requires disclosure of evidence relied upon, particularly exculpatory material or evidence contradicting regulatory theories. Non-disclosure may render proceedings fundamentally unfair.

**Opportunity to respond**: Affected parties must have genuine opportunity to address evidence and submissions before decisions. This may require oral hearings where credibility or complex factual issues arise.

### Legitimate Expectations in Regulatory Context

Regulators frequently issue guidance, policies, or individual assurances upon which regulated entities rely. Legitimate expectations doctrine protects reasonable reliance:

**Policy-based expectations**: Where regulators publish policies indicating how discretion will be exercised, individuals may expect policies will be followed absent good reason. Unexplained departures may breach legitimate expectations.

**Individual representations**: Specific assurances to individuals create particularly strong expectations. Regulators frustrating such expectations must demonstrate compelling public interest justifications.

**Consultation expectations**: Established practices of consulting stakeholders before policy changes may create expectations that consultation will occur. Changes implemented without expected consultation may be challenged.

### Reasons in Regulatory Decisions

Regulatory decisions particularly require adequate reasons given their significant impacts on regulated entities and the public. Reasons serve accountability functions by:

- Demonstrating regulators considered relevant factors
- Enabling meaningful appeals or judicial review
- Promoting regulatory consistency through transparency
- Building public confidence in regulatory impartiality

Decisions lacking adequate reasons are vulnerable to challenge, particularly where they depart from established patterns, reject expert evidence, or impose severe sanctions.

## Institutional Accountability and Administrative Law

Administrative law provides frameworks for challenging institutional failures and demanding accountability when agencies breach legal duties. Several principles are particularly relevant to systematic accountability analysis:

### Identifying Jurisdictional Errors

Agencies frequently exceed statutory authority through:

**Expansion of jurisdiction**: Acting in areas beyond statutory remit
**Misinterpretation of powers**: Reading broad powers into narrow statutory provisions
**Improper delegation**: Delegating non-delegable functions or failing to exercise independent judgment

Systematic review of statutory frameworks against actual agency practices identifies jurisdictional errors amenable to challenge.

### Detecting Procedural Failures

Natural justice violations are particularly prevalent in institutional contexts involving multiple agencies. Key indicators include:

**Failure to notify**: Affected individuals not informed of proceedings or evidence
**Denial of hearing**: Decisions made without genuine opportunity to respond
**Inadequate disclosure**: Material evidence withheld from affected parties
**Bias**: Decision-makers with interests in outcomes or pre-determined views

Cross-referencing procedural requirements against actual decision-making processes reveals challengeable defects.

### Mapping Irrational Decision-Making

Wednesbury irrationality, whilst a high threshold, is demonstrable where:

- Decisions are unsupported by or contrary to evidence
- Agencies fail to consider obviously material factors
- Conclusions are logically inconsistent with premises
- Agencies apply inappropriate or disproportionate weight to factors

Systematic contradiction analysis (identifying internal inconsistencies, temporal shifts, and evidential gaps) provides foundation for irrationality challenges.

### Enforcing Duties to Give Reasons

Where agencies fail to provide reasons or offer inadequate reasons that do not address principal issues, administrative law provides grounds for challenge. This is particularly powerful where:

- Statutory duties to give reasons exist
- Decisions affect fundamental interests (liberty, family life, reputation)
- Decisions appear aberrant requiring explanation
- Appeals or reviews are impossible without understanding reasoning

Demanding and scrutinising reasons exposes defective decision-making whilst creating accountability records.

## Connection to Phronesis Platform

The Phronesis platform's **Accountability Audit Engine (Λ)** operationalises administrative law principles for systematic institutional accountability analysis. The engine maps statutory duties, procedural requirements, and decision-making standards against actual agency actions to identify legal vulnerabilities.

### Illegality Detection

The Accountability Engine identifies jurisdictional errors by:

- Extracting statutory powers and limitations from enabling legislation
- Mapping agency actions against statutory authority
- Flagging ultra vires actions exceeding statutory remit
- Detecting improper purposes or irrelevant considerations through claim analysis

This systematic approach reveals illegality patterns across multiple decisions or agencies that might escape ad hoc review.

### Procedural Impropriety Mapping

Natural justice violations are detected through:

- Timeline analysis identifying when notice was provided relative to decisions
- Document analysis revealing what evidence was disclosed
- Communication analysis showing whether genuine opportunities to respond existed
- Pattern analysis detecting systematic procedural failures across cases

The platform's **Temporal Parser (Τ)** reconstructs procedural timelines, whilst the **Entity Resolution Engine (Ε)** tracks which actors received notice, had opportunities to respond, and participated in decisions.

### Irrationality Identification

The **Contradiction Engine (Κ)** and **Bias Detection Engine (Β)** identify irrationality through:

- Cross-document contradiction analysis revealing logically inconsistent positions
- Evidence-claim gap analysis showing assertions unsupported by evidence
- Statistical bias analysis demonstrating systematic favouring of particular outcomes
- Consideration analysis identifying failure to address material factors

These capabilities operationalise Wednesbury review by systematically identifying decisions that cannot withstand rationality scrutiny.

### Legitimate Expectations Analysis

The platform tracks:

- Policy statements and guidance establishing patterns of decision-making
- Individual representations creating specific expectations
- Historical practices establishing consultation patterns
- Departures from established patterns requiring justification

This enables identification of legitimate expectations breaches across multiple decisions.

### Reasons Analysis

The **Argumentation Engine (Α)** evaluates reasons adequacy by:

- Extracting stated reasons from decisions
- Mapping reasons against statutory criteria and relevant considerations
- Identifying gaps where principal issues are not addressed
- Comparing reasons to supporting evidence

Inadequate reasons are flagged as independent grounds for challenge whilst revealing underlying decision-making defects.

### Systematic Cascade Analysis

Administrative law violations rarely occur in isolation. The platform's **Cascade Architecture** traces how:

- Initial jurisdictional errors propagate through subsequent decisions
- Procedural failures in one agency affect others' decisions
- Irrational premises inherited by multiple institutions
- Natural justice violations compound across multi-agency contexts

This reveals systemic accountability failures requiring comprehensive challenge rather than isolated corrections.

## Case Study: Contact Enforcement Under SGOs

Administrative law principles apply directly to family court proceedings and local authority decisions regarding contact enforcement. Consider a Special Guardianship Order specifying fortnightly contact in recitals, implemented as monthly contact, eventually ceasing entirely.

### Illegality Analysis

**Statutory duties**: Children Act 1989 s.14C requires special guardians to permit contact specified in orders. Local authorities under s.17 and s.27 have duties to support families in need and cooperate with requests for assistance.

**Jurisdictional questions**: Has the special guardian acted ultra vires by reducing contact frequency below court order specifications? Have local authorities failed to fulfil statutory cooperation duties when requested to facilitate contact?

### Procedural Impropriety

**Natural justice**: Was the non-resident parent given adequate notice and opportunity to address concerns before contact ceased? Were reasons provided explaining the departure from court-ordered frequency?

**Fair hearing**: If allegations motivated contact cessation, were they disclosed, allowing response before decisions affecting parental contact?

### Irrationality

**Wednesbury unreasonableness**: Is reduction from fortnightly to monthly contact, without explanation or court variation, rationally defensible given court's welfare assessment ordering fortnightly contact?

**Evidential basis**: If contact cessation is justified by child welfare concerns, is there adequate evidence supporting those concerns? Are they consistent with previous professional assessments?

### Legitimate Expectations

**Court order reliance**: Did the non-resident parent have legitimate expectation that court-ordered contact would be implemented as specified? Does departure without explanation or court variation breach that expectation?

**Established practice**: If contact occurred at specified frequency initially, does established practice create expectation it will continue absent changed circumstances?

### Proportionality

**Article 8 ECHR**: Does complete cessation of contact pursue a legitimate aim (child welfare)? Is it rationally connected to that aim? Could less restrictive measures achieve welfare protection? Is complete severance of parent-child relationship proportionate to welfare concerns?

Administrative law provides frameworks for challenging each defect whilst procedurally exhausting available remedies before court applications.

## Conclusion

UK administrative law establishes robust frameworks for scrutinising agency action and demanding institutional accountability. The tripartite grounds of judicial review—illegality, irrationality, and procedural impropriety—combined with natural justice principles, legitimate expectations, and proportionality, create comprehensive standards for evaluating decision-making lawfulness.

For individuals and organisations seeking to challenge institutional decisions, administrative law provides:

- Doctrinal frameworks identifying when agencies exceed powers or breach duties
- Procedural standards establishing minimum fairness requirements
- Rationality thresholds beyond which decisions cannot stand
- Expectation protections preventing arbitrary departures from representations
- Proportionality requirements where fundamental rights engage

Systematic application of these principles, operationalised through platforms like Phronesis, enables comprehensive accountability analysis. Rather than ad hoc challenge of individual decisions, administrative law supports structural critique identifying patterns of unlawful action across agencies and decision-types.

The effectiveness of administrative law depends upon vigorous application. Agencies aware that decisions will face scrutiny are more likely to exercise powers lawfully, consider relevant factors, provide procedural fairness, and articulate rational justifications. Administrative law thus serves both remedial functions—correcting individual injustices—and systemic functions—promoting lawful, rational, and fair institutional decision-making.

As Lord Steyn observed in *R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Pierson* [1998] AC 539, administrative law protects "fundamental human rights" and "the rule of law." It ensures that executive power, however broadly conferred, remains subject to legal limits and judicial supervision. In an era of expansive administrative states and complex regulatory frameworks, these protections remain essential bulwarks against arbitrary power.
