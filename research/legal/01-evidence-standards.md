# Evidence Standards in UK Law

## Introduction

English law operates on the fundamental principle that justice depends on reliable evidence. The evidential framework distinguishes between what can be admitted in proceedings (admissibility) and what weight that evidence should carry (probative value). This distinction becomes critical in family proceedings, where decisions affecting children's welfare rest on the court's assessment of conflicting accounts, expert reports, and institutional records.

The standard of proof in civil and family proceedings is the balance of probabilities - the court must be satisfied that an allegation is more likely than not to be true. Unlike criminal proceedings (beyond reasonable doubt), this lower threshold means evidential reliability becomes paramount. Weak evidence meeting admissibility requirements may still carry insufficient weight to discharge the burden of proof.

## Civil Evidence Act 1995: Hearsay in Civil Proceedings

### The Hearsay Rule Reformed

The Civil Evidence Act 1995 abolished the common law rule against hearsay in civil proceedings. Section 1(1) provides that "evidence shall not be excluded on the ground that it is hearsay." This represents a fundamental shift from the pre-1995 position, where hearsay was presumptively inadmissible unless it fell within recognised exceptions.

However, admissibility is not the end of the inquiry. Section 4 establishes a statutory framework for assessing the weight of hearsay evidence:

**Factors affecting weight (s.4(2)):**
1. Whether it would have been reasonable and practicable to produce the original maker of the statement
2. Whether the original statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence of the matters stated
3. Whether the evidence involves multiple hearsay (hearsay of hearsay)
4. Whether any person involved had any motive to conceal or misrepresent matters
5. Whether the original statement was an edited account, or was made in collaboration with another for a particular purpose
6. Whether the circumstances suggest an attempt to prevent proper evaluation of its weight

### Notice Requirements

Section 2 imposes procedural requirements. A party intending to adduce hearsay evidence must serve notice on other parties, including:
- The fact that hearsay evidence will be relied upon
- Particulars of or relating to the evidence
- Such other matters as may be prescribed by rules of court

Failure to comply may result in the court refusing to admit the evidence or attaching reduced weight.

### Multiple Hearsay

Section 4(2)(b) specifically addresses "multiple hearsay" - statements based on other hearsay statements. Each step away from the original source compounds the risk of distortion, misunderstanding, or selective transmission. A social worker's report citing a police officer's account of a witness statement represents triple hearsay, with three opportunities for material alteration.

## Family Procedure Rules 2010: Evidence in Family Court

### Part 22: Evidence

FPR 22.1 incorporates the Civil Evidence Act 1995 for family proceedings, with modifications. The overriding objective (FPR 1.1) - dealing with cases justly, having regard to welfare issues - influences evidential rulings.

**Key provisions:**
- **FPR 22.2**: Evidence at hearings (general rule: witness statement stands as evidence-in-chief)
- **FPR 22.3**: Evidence by video link or other means
- **FPR 22.4**: Service of witness statements
- **FPR 22.5**: Cross-examination on witness statements

### Practice Direction 22A: Written Evidence

PD22A establishes formal requirements for witness statements:
- Must be headed with case details
- Must be in the witness's own words
- Must indicate which statements are made from the witness's own knowledge and which are matters of information or belief (and the source)
- Must be verified by a statement of truth

The requirement to distinguish between direct knowledge, information, and belief directly addresses the hearsay/primary evidence distinction. A social worker stating "X told me that Y said..." must identify this as information received, not personal observation.

### Children Act Proceedings

In proceedings under the Children Act 1989, the court's paramount consideration is the child's welfare (s.1(1)). This does not lower evidential standards but influences how evidence is assessed. The welfare checklist (s.1(3)) requires consideration of:
- The ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child
- The child's physical, emotional and educational needs
- The likely effect of any change in circumstances
- The child's age, sex, background and relevant characteristics
- Any harm suffered or risk of suffering harm
- Capability of parents/others in meeting the child's needs
- The range of powers available to the court

Each factor depends on evidence. A local authority asserting "risk of harm" must adduce evidence establishing the factual basis for that risk. Unparticularised allegations or assertions unsupported by contemporaneous records will carry minimal weight.

## Expert Evidence: Part 35 CPR Requirements

### Duties to the Court

Expert evidence in family proceedings is governed by Part 25 FPR (which applies Part 35 CPR with modifications). The cardinal principle is established in CPR 35.3: **"It is the duty of experts to help the court on matters within their expertise."** This duty overrides any obligation to the instructing party.

**CPR 35.3(2) - Expert's duties:**
- To comply with the duty to help the court
- To assist the court in achieving the overriding objective
- Not to mislead by omission or commission

### Form and Content of Expert Reports

CPR 35.10 and Practice Direction 35 prescribe mandatory content:
1. Details of the expert's qualifications and experience
2. A statement setting out the substance of all material instructions
3. The facts and assumptions upon which opinions are based
4. An indication of whether any proposition is outside the expert's expertise
5. A summary of the range of opinion in the field
6. A summary of conclusions reached
7. A statement of truth in prescribed form

**The prescribed statement of truth:**
"I confirm that I have made clear which facts and matters referred to in this report are within my own knowledge and which are not. Those that are within my own knowledge I confirm to be true. The opinions I have expressed represent my true and complete professional opinions on the matters to which they refer."

### Scope and Limitations

An expert must operate within recognised boundaries of competence. In *Liverpool Roman Catholic Archdiocesan Trust v Goldberg* [2001] 1 WLR 2337, the Court of Appeal emphasised that experts should not usurp the court's function by expressing opinions on matters of law or ultimate issues properly within judicial determination.

**The expert may:**
- Explain technical matters outside the court's expertise
- Identify possibilities consistent with observed facts
- Express opinions within the recognised scope of the discipline

**The expert must not:**
- Express opinions on credibility (court's function)
- Decide contested factual issues (court's function)
- Offer conclusions on ultimate legal questions
- Stray beyond the recognised boundaries of the discipline

### The Problem of "Advocacy by Expert"

Where an expert report shows signs of partisan advocacy, the court may discount it entirely. Red flags include:
- Selective citation of research supporting one party's case
- Failure to acknowledge contrary evidence or alternative explanations
- Exceeding the scope of instructions to address issues favourable to the instructing party
- Use of language suggesting alignment with party positions rather than neutral analysis

## Hierarchy of Evidence: Assessing Probative Weight

### Primary Sources

**Direct witness testimony** - The witness personally observed or experienced the event. Subject to cross-examination, this represents the strongest form of evidence. Contemporaneous notes made shortly after the event enhance reliability.

**Original documents** - The document itself, created at the time of the events it records. A GP's clinical notes made during consultation carry greater weight than a retrospective summary.

**Physical evidence** - Objects, recordings, photographs created by the event itself. CCTV footage showing what occurred at a specific time is primary evidence of those events.

### Secondary Sources

**Hearsay evidence** - Statements made outside court, adduced to prove the truth of their contents. Weight depends on Section 4 factors (above).

**Copies and summaries** - Documents derived from originals. Risk of transcription error, selective extraction, or editorial alteration.

**Retrospective accounts** - Witness statements created long after events, susceptible to memory decay and reconstruction.

### Opinion Evidence

**Expert opinion** - Admissible where it assists the court on technical matters. Weight depends on expert's qualifications, methodology, and adherence to duties.

**Lay opinion** - Generally inadmissible, except for matters of ordinary observation (a witness's impression of another's emotional state, for example).

**Institutional opinion** - Reports from local authorities, police, health services often conflate observation (admissible) with evaluative judgment (may exceed the author's expertise).

### The Documentary Cascade

Consider this common scenario in family proceedings:

1. **Original event**: Mother takes child to GP. GP makes clinical notes: "Mother reports child said 'daddy shouted.'"
2. **Social worker's report**: "GP records indicate domestic abuse in the home."
3. **Guardian's report**: "There is a documented history of domestic violence."
4. **Judgment**: "I find on the evidence a pattern of domestic abuse."

At each stage, the evidential foundation degrades:
- **GP notes**: Hearsay (child's statement) but contemporaneous, from direct conversation
- **Social worker**: Double hearsay, interpretive leap from "shouted" to "abuse"
- **Guardian**: Triple hearsay, abstracted to "pattern" and "violence"
- **Judgment**: Conclusion resting on compounded hearsay and semantic drift

This is not an evidentiary chain; it is institutional inheritance without verification.

## Documentary Evidence: Authentication and Weight

### Authentication Requirements

A document must be proved to be what it purports to be. This may require:
- Witness testimony identifying the document
- Evidence of chain of custody
- Metadata (for electronic documents)
- Handwriting evidence or signature verification

**Section 7 Civil Evidence Act 1995** creates presumptions for business documents where:
- The document was created in the course of business
- The person supplying information had personal knowledge of the matters stated
- The person who created the record had a duty to do so

These presumptions are rebuttable. If metadata shows a document was created months after its stated date, or if the purported author denies creating it, authentication fails.

### Assessing Weight

Even authenticated documents vary in reliability:

**High weight:**
- Contemporaneous creation
- Author had direct knowledge
- Created in ordinary course (not for litigation)
- No apparent motive to distort
- Corroborated by other sources

**Reduced weight:**
- Retrospective creation
- Author recording others' accounts (hearsay)
- Created in anticipation of proceedings
- Author has potential bias or conflict
- Contradicted by contemporaneous records

### The "Institutional Record" Problem

Documents created by state agencies often carry unwarranted presumptive weight. Courts may treat police reports, social services case notes, or local authority assessments as inherently reliable, overlooking their hearsay nature or the institutional incentives that shaped their creation.

**Critical questions:**
- Who created this document and when?
- What was the purpose of creation?
- What sources did the author rely upon?
- Were those sources verified?
- Does the document conflate observation and interpretation?
- Are there material omissions?

A police report stating "Subject was uncooperative" may reflect:
- Accurate observation of refusal to answer questions (primary evidence)
- Mischaracterisation of a lawful exercise of rights (interpretive overlay)
- Selective omission of cooperation that did occur (material gap)

Without the underlying records (custody logs, interview transcripts), the court cannot assess which interpretation is correct.

## Connection to Forensic Document Analysis

### The Systematic Adversarial Methodology (S.A.M.)

Phronesis employs S.A.M. to expose evidential weaknesses that traditional legal scrutiny may miss. The methodology operates through four phases:

**1. ANCHOR**: Identify the origin of a claim. When did this assertion first appear? In whose document? Based on what stated source?

**2. INHERIT**: Trace propagation across institutional boundaries. Which subsequent documents adopted the claim without independent verification?

**3. COMPOUND**: Document authority accumulation. How did repetition across multiple institutional reports transform a tentative observation into an accepted "fact"?

**4. ARRIVE**: Map the catastrophic outcome. How did this false premise, compounded through inheritance, lead to materially unjust decisions?

### Alignment with Legal Standards

S.A.M. operationalises the Section 4 factors:

**Section 4(2)(a) - Practicability of calling original maker**: S.A.M. identifies when later reports rely on unavailable or unidentified sources, triggering this factor.

**Section 4(2)(b) - Contemporaneity**: ANCHOR phase timestamps claim origins, exposing retrospective insertions.

**Section 4(2)(c) - Multiple hearsay**: INHERIT phase counts hearsay steps, calculating evidential degradation.

**Section 4(2)(d) - Motive to conceal or misrepresent**: COMPOUND phase examines institutional incentives and omission patterns.

**Section 4(2)(e) - Edited account or collaboration**: Documentary analysis detects version control anomalies, suggesting post-creation alteration.

**Section 4(2)(f) - Preventing proper evaluation**: The entire S.A.M. framework is designed to restore evaluability when institutional complexity obscures evidential foundations.

### Practical Application: Contact Enforcement

In PE23C50095, a Special Guardianship Order specified fortnightly contact in its recitals. Implementation records show monthly contact, then cessation. The respondent's position evolved across multiple hearings:

1. **Initial position**: "Contact is ongoing as ordered."
2. **Amended position**: "Contact occurs but at reduced frequency due to child's needs."
3. **Current position**: "Contact is not in child's best interests."

Each position shift appears in institutional reports without acknowledgment of the prior inconsistent position. S.A.M. analysis exposes:

**ANCHOR**: The original order specified fortnightly contact. The first deviation (monthly) appears in a social worker's note without explanation or application to vary.

**INHERIT**: Guardian's report adopts monthly contact as if it were the order's requirement, conflating implementation with instruction.

**COMPOUND**: Court's subsequent directions reference "existing contact arrangements" without identifying the departure from the order.

**ARRIVE**: Six months of no contact, with no enforcement, no variation application, and no consequence for breach.

From an evidence law perspective:
- The order itself is primary evidence of what was ordered
- Social worker's note is hearsay evidence of what occurred
- Guardian's report compounds the hearsay and introduces interpretive error
- Absence of contemporaneous contact logs prevents verification

S.A.M. reveals what legal argument might miss: the evidential cascade that transformed a clear order into an unenforceable suggestion.

## Conclusion

UK evidence law provides rigorous standards for assessing reliability, particularly in civil and family proceedings where hearsay is admissible but must be carefully weighed. The Civil Evidence Act 1995 framework, Family Procedure Rules, and Part 35 expert requirements create a comprehensive system for evaluating what the court can rely upon.

Yet institutional documents often bypass this scrutiny. Reports prepared by state agencies, carrying the imprimatur of professional authority, may be treated as primary evidence when they are in fact multiple hearsay. Experts may exceed their remit, offering conclusions on ultimate issues or credibility. Courts, operating under case management pressures, may not conduct the granular source analysis that Section 4 contemplates.

Forensic document analysis through S.A.M. methodology restores the rigour that adversarial litigation should provide but often does not. By tracing claim origins, mapping inheritance patterns, quantifying compounding effects, and connecting evidential failures to outcomes, it makes visible the hidden vulnerabilities in what courts treat as established fact.

The law provides the tools. S.A.M. ensures they are used.
